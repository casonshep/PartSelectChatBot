To install the new shelf, line it up with the shelf cut-outs, over the tabs, and gently press it down to lock it into place. This part generally fits the middle door shelf of refrigerators. This is a part that frequently requires multiple parts per refrigerator. Because it is sold individually, you will need to purchase as many door racks as necessary to complete your repair.

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing.

Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.

Remove four Philips screws holding plastic cover to inside of the door. there are no clip/snaps to worry about but on/off switch needs to be un plugged. Remove cover.
Remove two nut head screws holding old ice maker.
Remove wiring harness from ice maker and lift ice maker up and out. There are two tabs on the door.
Unplug the wiring harness from the ice maker..

Installation: Press the wiring harness into clips on the new ice maker. Install ice maker onto door insuring it is over the tabs on door and the holes for nut screws line up. Plugging the wiring harness in and install two screws.

Plug on/off wiring onto switch and press plastic cover onto inside of door. Take care that it fits inside of rubber door seal. Install four philips screws.

Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Richard from N CALDWELL, NJ
Ice maker was not working
Simple three steps... 1) There's an front section to the ice-maker to take off. One Phillips screw is on the side, one screw is underneath near the inside of the refrigerator wall. Just unscrew and store. 2) There's a small plastic unit just inside the ice maker to take out. It's held in by a small nut that requires about a 4"" extension to reach. (You may be able to unscrew the nut with small needle-nose pliers). Just unscrew and take out the unit - the unit functions just to keep the ice maker wiring in place. 3) The wiring looks a mess, but there's just one wiring connector to the ice maker assembly. Unsnap it. The ice maker is not screwed in, it just slides in -- reach in and pull the assembly straight out; when it stops, lower it a bit and it will come free. Reverse the instructions to install the new unit.

Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage and water quality. This model is mounted on the freezer wall.

Two screws held the icemaker on. You do not even have to take them all the way out to remove the IM. Replacement of the water valve was just as easy except they (parts manufacturer) updated the flange nut with a compression fitting and it took me a minute looking at it before I realize what was going on. The door seal could not be easier, no tools just a few minutes of time

Remove the icemaker service door... gently pry the door pins from the hinge sockets. Remove the 3 screws from the under side of the icemaker with a nut driver (1/4""). Gently remove the icemaker . It's a tight fit between the top of the compartment and the icemaker lower support tray. Next, disconnect the electrical connector at the right side. You're done! Reverse procedure for installing.

Robert from Valencia, CA
Ice maker's ice tray coating coming off, ice bin had foul odor.
I noticed the coating inside the ice maker, the lining on the surface that the water contacts when making ice, was chipping off. I replaced the ice maker with a new unit and now there's no more bits of stuff in my ice. The other problem I had was the ice bin, it had picked up a weird smell over the years and I wanted to replace it. The new bin seems flimsier, but works fine. It didn't have the top attachment hole for the ice auger mechanism drilled out for some reason, it had a little ""bump"" in the plastic where it should be, but was never drilled out. Easy enough, I drilled the hole out and attached that top screw without any issue.

John from WELLTON, AZ
The ice maker had a internal brownish leak substance. This in turn dripped on the ice in the tray, which froze the ice cubes in a ball which would not let the ice to be ejected from the dispenser, and in turn cracked the tray which holds the ice cubes, so I had to replace the tray and ice maker.
On a side by side refer, you need both doors open to unscrew the three 1/4 inch screws,
1. Remove the ice tray
2.the ice arm needs to be in the up position, so no water will flow while dissembling.
3. Remove the two top screws,
4. While holding the ice maker with o e hand, remove the bottom screw.
Balance the ice maker and unplug the ice make electric plug in the rear of the ice maker.
5. Take the I e maker out.
6. The ice maker does not come with the ice arm, so you need to remove the arm from the old or broken ice maker and install it in the new ice maker.
7. Resemble in reverse order.

I did not unplug the refer from the wall socket, you may want to do this. It recommended but I did not.
There you go.

Just unscrew and store. 2) There's a small plastic unit just inside the ice maker to take out. It's held in by a small nut that requires about a 4"" extension to reach. (You may be able to unscrew the nut with small needle-nose pliers). Just unscrew and take out the unit - the unit functions just to keep the ice maker wiring in place. 3) The wiring looks a mess, but there's just one wiring connector to the ice maker assembly. Unsnap it. The ice maker is not screwed in, it just slides in -- reach in and pull the assembly straight out; when it stops, lower it a bit and it will come free. Reverse the instructions to install the new unit.

This 10 by 5 inch ice maker (Electromechanical Icemaker Kit, Ice Maker Assembly) produces ice. This particular model will produce seven crescent shaped cubes every cycle. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white. This kit includes a set of installation instructions, a 4-pin round plug-in connector, 6 post plug-in connectors, tube and fill cup. The ideal temperature of a freezer is zero degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature in your freezer is at an appropriate level yet ice is still not being made, it could be an issue with the water inlet valve or your ice maker assembly. If you determine it is the ice maker, this is the replacement you need. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage and water quality. This model is mounted on the freezer wall.

ice maker not working properly and door seal worn
Two screws held the icemaker on. You do not even have to take them all the way out to remove the IM. Replacement of the water valve was just as easy except they (parts manufacturer) updated the flange nut with a compression fitting and it took me a minute looking at it before I realize what was going on. The door seal could not be easier, no tools just a few minutes of time

Remove the icemaker service door... gently pry the door pins from the hinge sockets. Remove the 3 screws from the under side of the icemaker with a nut driver (1/4""). Gently remove the icemaker .

Ice maker's ice tray coating coming off, ice bin had foul odor.
I noticed the coating inside the ice maker, the lining on the surface that the water contacts when making ice, was chipping off. I replaced the ice maker with a new unit and now there's no more bits of stuff in my ice. The other problem I had was the ice bin, it had picked up a weird smell over the years and I wanted to replace it. The new bin seems flimsier, but works fine. It didn't have the top attachment hole for the ice auger mechanism drilled out for some reason, it had a little ""bump"" in the plastic where it should be, but was never drilled out. Easy enough, I drilled the hole out and attached that top screw without any issue.

John from WELLTON, AZ
The ice maker had a internal brownish leak substance. This in turn dripped on the ice in the tray, which froze the ice cubes in a ball which would not let the ice to be ejected from the dispenser, and in turn cracked the tray which holds the ice cubes, so I had to replace the tray and ice maker.
On a side by side refer, you need both doors open to unscrew the three 1/4 inch screws,
1. Remove the ice tray
2.the ice arm needs to be in the up position, so no water will flow while dissembling.
3. Remove the two top screws,
4. While holding the ice maker with o e hand, remove the bottom screw.
Balance the ice maker and unplug the ice make electric plug in the rear of the ice maker.
5. Take the I e maker out.
6. The ice maker does not come with the ice arm, so you need to remove the arm from the old or broken ice maker and install it in the new ice maker.
7. Resemble in reverse order.

I did not unplug the refer from the wall socket, you may want to do this. It recommended but I did not.
There you go.

James from NEW LONDON, NH
Ice maker has stopped making ice and made a loud banging sound
I turned the water and electricity off for the refrigerator.
(not sure if this is necessary but is safer)
Remove the ice bucket.
Cover the Ice auger with a hand towel to catch any screws which my get dropped.
Remove four Philips screws holding plastic cover to inside of the door. there are no clip/snaps to worry about but on/off switch needs to be un plugged. Remove cover.
Remove two nut head screws holding old ice maker.
Remove wiring harness from ice maker and lift ice maker up and out. There are two tabs on the door.
Unplug the wiring harness from the ice maker..

Installation: Press the wiring harness into clips on the new ice maker. Install ice maker onto door insuring it is over the tabs on door and the holes for nut screws line up. Plugging the wiring harness in and install two screws.

Plug on/off wiring onto switch and press plastic cover onto inside of door. Take care that it fits inside of rubber door seal. Install four philips screws.
Remove hand towel and install ice bucket making sure the ice maker is switched on. Close door.
Turn on water and electricity.

This took me 25 min. and I am sure would go faster if I had had instructions.

My refrigerator took awhile before it started to make cubes but has been working like new ever since.
This task is easy go for it.

Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Refrigerator Door Gasket - White
★★★★★
★★★★★
18 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9493819
Manufacturer Part Number 242193206
This is an OEM door gasket, also known as a door seal, for various refrigerators. A door gasket is used to create a barrier between the warmer, ambient temperature of your home, and the cooler interior of the refrigerator. But if used for a long period of time, or simply after general wear and tear, this gasket can tear, break, and/or warp. If your gasket is broken, warped, or moldy, it will need to be replaced immediately. To replace this gasket, carefully peel out the old gasket and discard it, then carefully wrap the new gasket around the frame of the fridge door to install it. This door gasket is white and rectangular and measures 28.5 inches long, .75 inches thick, and approximately 42 inches wide. This door gasket is sold individually and does not come with any other parts or accessories.

Lorrie from LOMPOC, CA
Refrigerator section wasn't chilling
I pulled the old gasket off and thoroughly cleaned the entire refrigerator door, including the area where the gasket would pop into. Starting at the two upper corners, I pushed the corners into the ridge in the door and used my thumbs to press the gasket in along the top of the door. I then went about halfway down the door using my thumbs to push in the gasket. Then I pushed the lower corners in, taking my thumbs up either side of the door to finish installing that section then I pushed the bottom in, checking the lower corners to make sure they were secure. Then I closed the door and made sure the seal was secure on both sides of the door.

Installation Instructions
Matthew from Washington, DC
Refrigerator door gasket torn
No instructions included, so it took a little bit of staring at the new part to figure out how it works. The barbed ridge on the gasket fits into a slot on the door. The flat face of the gasket has an internal magnetic strip that helps keep the seal tight against the steel face of the refrigerator. Installation requires no tools. This is the basic process:
1) Unbox the new gasket and get it ready to install so you don't have to leave the fridge open too long.
2) Open the door and grab the old gasket at one of the corners and pull away. This will unseat the barbed ridge I mentioned above. Work your way around the door until the whole gasket is free.
3) Set aside the old gasket
4) Grab a moistened paper towel and wipe down the (now exposed) sealing surface of the fridge and door.
5) Align the new gasket in the door and start pushing the barb into place. I found that the new gasket seemed slightly oversize compared to the original, so it took a little tweaking. What worked for me was to get all the corners seated, then work my way around the door making sure the gasket is fully seated.
6) Once you have the new gasket installed, close the door to make sure everything fits OK.
7) Open the door again and run your finger along the inside edge of the gasket seal. What you want to do is fold the edge of the gasket down so it lays flat against the outer wall of the door.
8) Shut the door and look from the sides and top to try to spot any gaps. You should be able to poke the gasket from the side and get the magnet strips to click into place. It seems like after a day or so the gasket 'relaxed' and I didn't have to worry about this anymore.
9) Dispose of the old gasket. I was able to pull the gasket into four pieces (separating at the corners) so it would fit in my city trash can...

Joel from DELRAY BEACH, FL
Door gasket wasnt sealing anymore and had some minor cracks
First, I removed the old door gasket by pulling it out of the channel it was mounted in, noting the orientation of the gasket. Then, it was a simple matter of lining the new gasket up with the channel and pressing it into the groove. Very easy repair, and the door seals great!

The lining of the gaskets were falling apart and the freezer was defrosting
I ordered a freezer gasket/insulation lining; just pulled the old one out and put in pressed in the new one; solved the problem easily. Then the refrigerator gasket was falling apart. I was ready to buy a new refrigerator but then I got laid off from work. I ordered the 2nd gasket. It did not fit easily at all. My husband had to man-handle and stretch it; then it worked, as worked well ever since. Spent $250 instead of $1250+. Thanks. P.S. Could not find the year of the frig.

This door gasket, also known as a door seal, is sourced from the original equipment manufacturer for use in refrigerators and freezers. It is a flexible rubber strip that runs along the edge of the appliance door. It creates an airtight seal between the door and cabinet to prevent cold air from escaping, and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to ensure that the temperature in the appliance remains constant. Over time, the door gasket can lose its elasticity or tear. In this case, you will likely notice frost build-up, increased noise, and inconsistent temperatures. Peel the faulty gasket off the refrigerator frame and remove any debris or residue on the surface. Carefully place the new seal along the edge of the door and press it firmly into place. Secure it with the appropriate fasteners and close the door to verify that there are no gaps between the door and cabinet.

Ice and frost were forming in a frost free freezer
The old gasket was obviously gapping, partially from age and partially from damage during a move. To make the repair, I loosened the screws that are under the gasket and hold it in, but did not remove them. Once all were loose, I removed the old gasket, then starting at the top, ran a thin bead of food grade RTV under the portion of the door that captures the gasket. I put the sealant on that edge only, then carefully worked one of the short edges of the gasket under the plastic and tightened all but the corner screws. I then ran the RTV down the inside of the hinge side of the door and repeated the process, this time tightening the top screw and the hinge side screw at the top, but leaving the bottom most screw loose. I repeated the process on the opening side of the door. The bottom was the hardest because the gasket seemed just a little long and it was hard to get the RTV up and behind the door portion, but after a couple tried I got a good bead of sealant then slid the gasket under the door capture and tightened all the remaining screws. After closing the door, it was obvious that there were places were it did not seal well. I used some cardboard strips, cut from the box the gasket came in, to place inside the freezer, between the hard plastic of the door and the inside of the gasket where it laps over the screws. This helped a lot, but there were still a couple small areas, so I used more cardboard, from the outside, between the main portion of the gasket and the rim of the gasket. This eliminated all the gaps. I let this sit overnight and this morning removed all the cardboard for a great sealing freezer.

Right door seal lower tab was torn.
Unpacked, inspected, found two minor defects in the form of two tiny slivers along the seal edge which I cut with a small scissor, laid the seal down on the kitchen table, applied heat to the deformed areas and reshaped them with my fingers, heated the entire seal lightly, removed the old seal starting at the right hand upper corner using my fingers, installed the warm seal starting at the top corners by pushing it in its slot making sure the outer lip stayed out of the slot and worked my way around. I believe that the heat from the dryer made it pliable and easier to manage.

This is an OEM door gasket, also known as a door seal, for various refrigerators. A door gasket is used to create a barrier between the warmer, ambient temperature of your home, and the cooler interior of the refrigerator.

If your gasket is broken, warped, or moldy, it will need to be replaced immediately. To replace this gasket, carefully peel out the old gasket and discard it, then carefully wrap the new gasket around the frame of the fridge door to install it. This door gasket is white and rectangular and measures 28.5 inches long, .75 inches thick, and approximately 42 inches wide. This door gasket is sold individually and does not come with any other parts or accessories.

Refrigerator section wasn't chilling
I pulled the old gasket off and thoroughly cleaned the entire refrigerator door, including the area where the gasket would pop into. Starting at the two upper corners, I pushed the corners into the ridge in the door and used my thumbs to press the gasket in along the top of the door. I then went about halfway down the door using my thumbs to push in the gasket. Then I pushed the lower corners in, taking my thumbs up either side of the door to finish installing that section then I pushed the bottom in, checking the lower corners to make sure they were secure. Then I closed the door and made sure the seal was secure on both sides of the door.

Refrigerator door gasket torn
No instructions included, so it took a little bit of staring at the new part to figure out how it works. The barbed ridge on the gasket fits into a slot on the door. The flat face of the gasket has an internal magnetic strip that helps keep the seal tight against the steel face of the refrigerator. Installation requires no tools. This is the basic process:
1) Unbox the new gasket and get it ready to install so you don't have to leave the fridge open too long.
2) Open the door and grab the old gasket at one of the corners and pull away. This will unseat the barbed ridge I mentioned above. Work your way around the door until the whole gasket is free.
3) Set aside the old gasket
4) Grab a moistened paper towel and wipe down the (now exposed) sealing surface of the fridge and door.
5) Align the new gasket in the door and start pushing the barb into place. I found that the new gasket seemed slightly oversize compared to the original, so it took a little tweaking. What worked for me was to get all the corners seated, then work my way around the door making sure the gasket is fully seated.
6) Once you have the new gasket installed, close the door to make sure everything fits OK.
7) Open the door again and run your finger along the inside edge of the gasket seal. What you want to do is fold the edge of the gasket down so it lays flat against the outer wall of the door.
8) Shut the door and look from the sides and top to try to spot any gaps. You should be able to poke the gasket from the side and get the magnet strips to click into place. It seems like after a day or so the gasket 'relaxed' and I didn't have to worry about this anymore.
9) Dispose of the old gasket. I was able to pull the gasket into four pieces (separating at the corners) so it would fit in my city trash can...

The lining of the gaskets were falling apart and the freezer was defrosting
I ordered a freezer gasket/insulation lining; just pulled the old one out and put in pressed in the new one; solved the problem easily. Then the refrigerator gasket was falling apart. I was ready to buy a new refrigerator but then I got laid off from work. I ordered the 2nd gasket. It did not fit easily at all. My husband had to man-handle and stretch it; then it worked, as worked well ever since. Spent $250 instead of $1250+. Thanks. P.S. Could not find the year of the frig.

Refrigerator Door Gasket

PartSelect Number PS11770644
Manufacturer Part Number 5304507200
This door gasket, also known as a door seal, is sourced from the original equipment manufacturer for use in refrigerators and freezers. It is a flexible rubber strip that runs along the edge of the appliance door. It creates an airtight seal between the door and cabinet to prevent cold air from escaping, and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to ensure that the temperature in the appliance remains constant. Over time, the door gasket can lose its elasticity or tear. In this case, you will likely notice frost build-up, increased noise, and inconsistent temperatures. Peel the faulty gasket off the refrigerator frame and remove any debris or residue on the surface. Carefully place the new seal along the edge of the door and press it firmly into place. Secure it with the appropriate fasteners and close the door to verify that there are no gaps between the door and cabinet.

Louise from Ocala, FL
Ice and frost were forming in a frost free freezer
The old gasket was obviously gapping, partially from age and partially from damage during a move. To make the repair, I loosened the screws that are under the gasket and hold it in, but did not remove them. Once all were loose, I removed the old gasket, then starting at the top, ran a thin bead of food grade RTV under the portion of the door that captures the gasket. I put the sealant on that edge only, then carefully worked one of the short edges of the gasket under the plastic and tightened all but the corner screws. I then ran the RTV down the inside of the hinge side of the door and repeated the process, this time tightening the top screw and the hinge side screw at the top, but leaving the bottom most screw loose. I repeated the process on the opening side of the door. The bottom was the hardest because the gasket seemed just a little long and it was hard to get the RTV up and behind the door portion, but after a couple tried I got a good bead of sealant then slid the gasket under the door capture and tightened all the remaining screws. After closing the door, it was obvious that there were places were it did not seal well. I used some cardboard strips, cut from the box the gasket came in, to place inside the freezer, between the hard plastic of the door and the inside of the gasket where it laps over the screws. This helped a lot, but there were still a couple small areas, so I used more cardboard, from the outside, between the main portion of the gasket and the rim of the gasket. This eliminated all the gaps. I let this sit overnight and this morning removed all the cardboard for a great sealing freezer.

Frederic from KILLEEN, TX
Right door seal lower tab was torn.
Unpacked, inspected, found two minor defects in the form of two tiny slivers along the seal edge which I cut with a small scissor, laid the seal down on the kitchen table, applied heat to the deformed areas and reshaped them with my fingers, heated the entire seal lightly, removed the old seal starting at the right hand upper corner using my fingers, installed the warm seal starting at the top corners by pushing it in its slot making sure the outer lip stayed out of the slot and worked my way around. I believe that the heat from the dryer made it pliable and easier to manage.

This light switch may also be known as a refrigerator door switch or a light switch kit, and is compatible with your refrigerator. The function of the refrigerator door switch is to turn on the light when your fridge door is open, and to make sure it is off when your refrigerator door is closed. The reason you would need to replace this part is if your light is not turning on when your door is open. For this repair, you will need a putty knife, and a small flat-blade screwdriver.

flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

The interior light in your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, or stays on when the door is closed, you could have a faulty switch. The switch is spring-loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is pushed, and continuity through the switch when it is no longer engaged. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat-blade screwdriver and needle-nose pliers.

Sticking Light Switch
I applied some tips learned by reading other reviews. So before I started I grabbed my trusty vise grip pliers and a small screw driver. I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

This is the light switch that goes in your refrigerator. If the light is not working or stays on, you may need to replace the switch. It is made of mainly white plastic, and is an OEM part, directly from the manufacturer. Be sure to disconnect the refrigerator from the power source before you begin this repair. To remove the switch, simply use a flathead screwdriver to pop the switch out from the refrigerator wall, then disconnect the wires. Reconnect the wires to the new switch, snap it into place, and the repair is complete.

This light switch may also be known as a refrigerator door switch or a light switch kit, and is compatible with your refrigerator. The function of the refrigerator door switch is to turn on the light when your fridge door is open, and to make sure it is off when your refrigerator door is closed. The reason you would need to replace this part is if your light is not turning on when your door is open. For this repair, you will need a putty knife, and a small flat-blade screwdriver.

Kevin from Beckley, WV
while closing the door, the light switch fouled, resulting in the switch breaking
I used a flat screwdriver and released the lock tab on the bottom of the light switch, and pried the switch out, being careful to not damage the plastic around the mounting place of the switch, unplugged wiring from old switch, plugged in the new one and pushed the new switch into place. Job finished light switch now working.

flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

Refrigerator Door Switch

97 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS3529268
Manufacturer Part Number 6600JB1010A
The interior light in your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, or stays on when the door is closed, you could have a faulty switch. The switch is spring-loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is pushed, and continuity through the switch when it is no longer engaged. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat-blade screwdriver and needle-nose pliers.

Remove and replace light switch
Video makes it look easy. Kenmore refrigerator does not have ""groove"" along the right hand side of switch that allows for pushing down on release. Used a thin screwdriver to get under to push while holding switch edge with pliers. Kept slipping. Tape sides to avoid scratching inside of refrigerator.

Wate Dispenser Not Working
Safety first, unplug fridge. Had to remove the top access panel, which consisted of 5 screws. Got access to the door switches. These are removed from the panel by depressing the plunger on the switch and sliding them out of the retainer. Transferred the wires over to the new switches one for one. Re-assembled. Dispenser works.

Sticking Light Switch
I applied some tips learned by reading other reviews. So before I started I grabbed my trusty vise grip pliers and a small screw driver. I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

This is the light switch that goes in your refrigerator. If the light is not working or stays on, you may need to replace the switch. It is made of mainly white plastic, and is an OEM part, directly from the manufacturer. Be sure to disconnect the refrigerator from the power source before you begin this repair. To remove the switch, simply use a flathead screwdriver to pop the switch out from the refrigerator wall, then disconnect the wires. Reconnect the wires to the new switch, snap it into place, and the repair is complete.

Refrigerator Upper or Lower Mullion Hinge Pin
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

William from OREFIELD, PA
Right door lower hinge assembly was damaged, such that the door sagged and would not open or close properly.
Unfortunately, I have still not managed to complete the repair, using the two parts indicated above, nor with the door bracket (part no WP2183805) that I ordered subsequently that arrived two days ago. It is not the same as, nor functionally equivalent to, the old bracket that I assumed was broken, since it was not retaining the piece in the base of the door into which the cam is inserted to mount the door. The new Cam is the correct part, but is not the solution since the old Cam is slightly worn but not damaged, and the thimble I bought does not seem to fit anywhere. The hole in the new bracket has a much too small hole to retain the Cam receptacle piece in place in the base of the door. However, this is the only lower door bracket shown in the PartSelect diagram of all the door parts used on a Whirlpool WRF560SMYM04 refrigerator. I do observe that the dark gray plastic cover on the base of the door is broken, but I don't imagine this plastic cover served to retain the Cam receptacle piece solidly in place, and this plastic cover is not offered as a replacement part either. At present I am at a total loss for how to proceed! However, the instructions for removing and replacing the door are clear and very easily carried out, and the job would be very quick and easy with the right parts. So beware if you are repairing the door on this model that the door parts diagram might not show all the parts to cover the door variations that apparently have been used!

You tube is my best friend for DIY repair. I supported the door with wood blocks, removed the bottom bracket and was able to slide the refrigerator door down and out without removing the freezer door. Replaced both hinge bearings and door stop and washer on bottom hinge and slid the door back into place. Door is very light when empty.

Right side door doesn't lift when closing
I failed to repair the problem and sent the parts back. The hinge bracket that I needed was WPW10524049. The hinge that I purchased was WP2183805. I gave up on trying to repair the door because it was not clear to me how to assemble the cam and hinge. There doesn't seem to be any obvious way to disassemble the hinge and cam that I have - which would allow me to replace the cam in the existing hinge.

Door sagging, creating a gap to let in condensation
You tube is my best friend for DIY repair. I supported the door with wood blocks, removed the bottom bracket and was able to slide the refrigerator door down and out without removing the freezer door. Replaced both hinge bearings and door stop and washer on bottom hinge and slid the door back into place. Door is very light when empty. Fast and easy, door opens and closes smoothly and no problem with condensation anymore.

Edward from Andover, CT
Refrigerator door was not sealing correctly.
Remove screws from lower hinge and carefully remove the door. In my case it was the lower bearing, flip door upside down being careful to remove anything which might fall off first. I removed the door stop and then pulled the broken bearing out with pliers. Then I pushed the new one in and reassembled it.

Right side door doesn't lift when closing
I failed to repair the problem and sent the parts back. The hinge bracket that I needed was WPW10524049. The hinge that I purchased was WP2183805. I gave up on trying to repair the door because it was not clear to me how to assemble the cam and hinge. There doesn't seem to be any obvious way to disassemble the hinge and cam that I have - which would allow me to replace the cam in the existing hinge.

Refrigerator Upper or Lower Mullion Hinge Pin
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

William from OREFIELD, PA
Right door lower hinge assembly was damaged, such that the door sagged and would not open or close properly.
Unfortunately, I have still not managed to complete the repair, using the two parts indicated above, nor with the door bracket (part no WP2183805) that I ordered subsequently that arrived two days ago. It is not the same as, nor functionally equivalent to, the old bracket that I assumed was broken, since it was not retaining the piece in the base of the door into which the cam is inserted to mount the door. The new Cam is the correct part, but is not the solution since the old Cam is slightly worn but not damaged, and the thimble I bought does not seem to fit anywhere. The hole in the new bracket has a much too small hole to retain the Cam receptacle piece in place in the base of the door. However, this is the only lower door bracket shown in the PartSelect diagram of all the door parts used on a Whirlpool WRF560SMYM04 refrigerator. I do observe that the dark gray plastic cover on the base of the door is broken, but I don't imagine this plastic cover served to retain the Cam receptacle piece solidly in place, and this plastic cover is not offered as a replacement part either. At present I am at a total loss for how to proceed! However, the instructions for removing and replacing the door are clear and very easily carried out, and the job would be very quick and easy with the right parts. So beware if you are repairing the door on this model that the door parts diagram might not show all the parts to cover the door variations that apparently have been used!

Unscrewd the top hinge cove and removed two bolts from the hinge, lifted door off of the bottom hinge and laid the whole door on the floor using a beach towel to protect it from scratches. Unbolted the bottom hinge plate, replaced it with the new one. Then pulled out the old hinge bearing and replaced with a new one. Installed the door back on the bottom hinge while the magnet on the door strip held it place and rebolted the the upper hinge and reinstalled the hinge cover. All done in less than 10 minutes.

Colin from Hollis, NY
Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

Dryer was sqeaking loudly when running
I Looked on internet sites for this type of problem.
Most sites said the support rollers could cause this.
I found your site PartSelect and with help of your diagrams of the machine ordered the parts I thought were needed plus other parts that might cause the problem.
With machine torn down I replaced the rollers.
I had also ordered the main drive belt and idler assembly with the rollers and these also needed replacement. It is a good idea to order other suspect parts when doing this type of repair since you can return the parts not needed.
Your return policy is great.

I was not able to unplug the refrigerator because it is housed in a built-in. I removed the icemaker and following simple instructions from YouTube was able to pry the cover off the existing part. After a few gentle tugs, I disconnected the pinned wires from the old part. Connecting the new part was a little tricky but I managed with a little contorting. As soon as the pins connected the freezer light as well as the refrig lights came on. It took about 15 minutes to complete.

78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

PartSelect Number PS217532

This 40-Watt light bulb is sold individually and is a genuine OEM replacement option for your home appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, so this bulb is compatible with a variety of appliance types including refrigerators, ranges, microwaves, and dryers. It features a frosted glass bulb with a standard metal socket base, which allows you to easily unscrew the burnt-out light and twist the new bulb into place. Depending on your appliance, there may be a guard or cover protecting the lightbulb, in which case you may require additional tools to remove the cover. We recommend disconnecting the power supply to your appliance before changing the lightbulb.

Broken plastic parts
Cleaned the refrigerator as the old parts were removed. Installed new parts as the old parts were removed so as to easily identify the replacement parts. Very easy and wife was extremely happy after old plastic parts self destructed over a period of months and refrigerator was essentially unusable on the bottom two drawers.

This OEM 40 watt appliance light bulb is used for some ranges, refrigerators, freezers, and microwaves. Simply locate the existing bulb, unscrew it from its socket, and replace with new light bulb.

Replace with the new bulb and reconnect the power to the refrigerator. These bulbs are sold individually and are a commonly replaced part; consider ordering a spare.
Installation Instructions
Colin from Hollis, NY
Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

The LED light module in the refrigerator failed. Dim and one LED not lit
There is a Philips head screw that holds the light cover on. Remove it. Pull the cover off from the back. It is rather tight so you need to pull fairly hard. Two tabs on the left side of the light hold the assembly in place. Release them and drop the module down. Unplug and do the reverse to put it back together.

The manual says to unplug.the refrigerator. Power to the light can be turned off by taping the door switch down.

Freezer light(s) were not coming on when freezer door was open
The PS11767930 BOARD LED LIGHT Assembly was an exact match to the one that had gone bad. First, I removed the shelf above the light cover and items on it. Next, remove the top 1/2 in phillips head screw holding the light cover in place. Next, pop off the light cover(2 slots on each side and 2 on back freezer wall. Next I popped off the plastic snap on holder at the end of the wires that contained the board LED lights. Then remove the wire plastic connection by holding it with needle nose pliers and a small screwdriver to lift up the plastic snap in connector. Take the new board and attach it just like you removed the old one. Let there be light! And so it was.

Dryer was sqeaking loudly when running
I Looked on internet sites for this type of problem.
Most sites said the support rollers could cause this.
I found your site PartSelect and with help of your diagrams of the machine ordered the parts I thought were needed plus other parts that might cause the problem.
With machine torn down I replaced the rollers.
I had also ordered the main drive belt and idler assembly with the rollers and these also needed replacement. It is a good idea to order other suspect parts when doing this type of repair since you can return the parts not needed.
Your return policy is great.

Freezer light out and refrigerator lights dim
I was not able to unplug the refrigerator because it is housed in a built-in. I removed the icemaker and following simple instructions from YouTube was able to pry the cover off the existing part. After a few gentle tugs, I disconnected the pinned wires from the old part. Connecting the new part was a little tricky but I managed with a little contorting. As soon as the pins connected the freezer light as well as the refrig lights came on. It took about 15 minutes to complete.

Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS7784018
Manufacturer Part Number 242252702
The function of the Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve (Triple Solenoid Water-Valve, Water Valve, Water Inlet Valve, Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) is to release water from the supply line when activated, and send it through to your water dispenser or ice maker in your refrigerator. The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker. To install the new water valve it was just a matter of reversing steps.

This water inlet valve (Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) supplies water to the ice maker and the water dispenser in your refrigerator. It is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. This replacement part features 1 dual inlet water valve with quick connections. It also has 1/4 and 5/16 John Guest fittings for the outlet lines and a 1/4 compression fitting for the inlet line.

Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working
The very first symptom here is important! The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working. You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect. Undo the connection and press the dispenser. If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door. 2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents. Wait 24 hours. This will usually unfreeze the line. Do not waste your time with a hair dryer. NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first. I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver. A shop towel is helpful for spilled water. A light is handy. Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit. Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply). Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator. On the left you will see the solenoid. It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced. They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar. One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple. Now simply unplug the electrical connections. In my case, one blue ""blade"" type connection (powering the water) and one red ""blade"" type connection powering the ice maker. They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them. pull the tubes clear of the solenoid. This is simple and needs no explantion. Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer). Replace the single screw. Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water. You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water. Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and look really tired when your wife sees that you worked ""so hard""! You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your ""exhausting"" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place. Writing this article took longer! My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!

The water inlet valve (Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Kit) provides water for the ice maker and water dispenser. This part is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. This breakage can occur from material fatigue or normal use, and is a sign the part should be replaced soon. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. The part measures approximately 6.5 inches long and 3 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue/green/red.

If you notice that the ice maker in your refrigerator is leaking or is not making or dispensing ice, you may need to replace the water inlet valve. When energized, the water inlet valve releases water from the supply line into the ice mold. The water inlet valve is in the back of your refrigerator so you will need to pull the fridge out from the wall before completing this repair. To complete this job, you will need a 1/2 inch wrench, a 1/4 inch nut driver and a utility knife. If your old inlet valve has a screw-in fitting, you may need to simply cut the end of the hose to fit in the new part. Be sure to disconnect both the water and power supply from the refrigerator prior to beginning this repair.

Neville from LITHONIA, GA
Not making ice in both ice maker or dispensing water
To confirm my diagnosis I first replace the filter still no water flow.
Check water supply from the wall valve: ok
Remove the entire inlet valve assembly and sit it over a small bucket.
Disconnect the tubing from the bottom of the 1st selenide valve: this is the one leading to the filter.
Place cup under water dispenser and activate dispenser. No water discharge from inlet valve confirm valve is bad.
Install the new valve matching the colored tubing with the color on each inlet valve.
Re-connect the water supply place container under water dispenser and activate: There will be a large gush of air then water. Dispense aprox 1 gallon of water to confirm all the air is purged from the system. Your refrigerator is now back to dispensing water and making ice.
Good luck everyone - Neville

Water on the floor, fridge leak
Back cover was wet in the area of the inlet valve(sign). Water on the floor. 90% of the time is a leaking inlet valve. But it could be frozen water on the drain pan- so I exposed the radiator fins and drain pan and looked. No ice so I went to the valve and opened the copper line valve and waited a few minutes- as soon as water was called by the. Ice maker it leaked. So I went ahead and replaced the valve and after I made sure no leaks were visible I replaced the back cover and continued to observe and all was good. I treated the fridge as a new installation, changed filter and dumped the next two ice buckets. Then I proceeded to demand brownie points.

No water and no ice being made
Checked to make sure water was going to the fridge and it was. Removed the 1st line after the valve and no water was present. Figured the valve was bad. Removed the wires to the old valve and also had to remove the wire harness on the new valve. It wasn't needed. Replaced the valve and installed the old wires. Hooked up the water line and instantly had water. A day later I had a full ice bucket. This part wasn't listed on GE website. But it was on partselect.com.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker. To install the new water valve it was just a matter of reversing steps.

This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal.

Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working
The very first symptom here is important! The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working. You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect. Undo the connection and press the dispenser. If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door. 2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents. Wait 24 hours. This will usually unfreeze the line. Do not waste your time with a hair dryer. NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first. I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver. A shop towel is helpful for spilled water. A light is handy. Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit. Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply). Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator. On the left you will see the solenoid. It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced. They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar. One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple. Now simply unplug the electrical connections. In my case, one blue ""blade"" type connection (powering the water) and one red ""blade"" type connection powering the ice maker. They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them. pull the tubes clear of the solenoid. This is simple and needs no explantion. Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer). Replace the single screw. Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water. You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water. Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and look really tired when your wife sees that you worked ""so hard""! You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your ""exhausting"" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place. Writing this article took longer! My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!

This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. This replacement part features 1 dual inlet water valve with quick connections. It also has 1/4 and 5/16 John Guest fittings for the outlet lines and a 1/4 compression fitting for the inlet line.

Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working
The very first symptom here is important! The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working. You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect. Undo the connection and press the dispenser. If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door. 2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents. Wait 24 hours. This will usually unfreeze the line. Do not waste your time with a hair dryer. NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first. I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver. A shop towel is helpful for spilled water. A light is handy. Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit. Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply). Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator. On the left you will see the solenoid. It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced. They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar. One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple. Now simply unplug the electrical connections. In my case, one blue ""blade"" type connection (powering the water) and one red ""blade"" type connection powering the ice maker. They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them. pull the tubes clear of the solenoid. This is simple and needs no explantion. Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer). Replace the single screw. Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water. You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water. Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and look really tired when your wife sees that you worked ""so hard""! You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your ""exhausting"" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place. Writing this article took longer! My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!

PartSelect Number PS7784017
Manufacturer Part Number 242252603
If you notice that the ice maker in your refrigerator is leaking or is not making or dispensing ice, you may need to replace the water inlet valve. When energized, the water inlet valve releases water from the supply line into the ice mold. The water inlet valve is in the back of your refrigerator so you will need to pull the fridge out from the wall before completing this repair. To complete this job, you will need a 1/2 inch wrench, a 1/4 inch nut driver and a utility knife. If your old inlet valve has a screw-in fitting, you may need to simply cut the end of the hose to fit in the new part. Be sure to disconnect both the water and power supply from the refrigerator prior to beginning this repair.

Neville from LITHONIA, GA
Not making ice in both ice maker or dispensing water
To confirm my diagnosis I first replace the filter still no water flow.
Check water supply from the wall valve: ok
Remove the entire inlet valve assembly and sit it over a small bucket.
Disconnect the tubing from the bottom of the 1st selenide valve: this is the one leading to the filter.
Place cup under water dispenser and activate dispenser. No water discharge from inlet valve confirm valve is bad.
Install the new valve matching the colored tubing with the color on each inlet valve.
Re-connect the water supply place container under water dispenser and activate: There will be a large gush of air then water. Dispense aprox 1 gallon of water to confirm all the air is purged from the system. Your refrigerator is now back to dispensing water and making ice.
Good luck everyone - Neville

Water on the floor, fridge leak
Back cover was wet in the area of the inlet valve(sign). Water on the floor. 90% of the time is a leaking inlet valve. But it could be frozen water on the drain pan- so I exposed the radiator fins and drain pan and looked. No ice so I went to the valve and opened the copper line valve and waited a few minutes- as soon as water was called by the. Ice maker it leaked. So I went ahead and replaced the valve and after I made sure no leaks were visible I replaced the back cover and continued to observe and all was good. I treated the fridge as a new installation, changed filter and dumped the next two ice buckets. Then I proceeded to demand brownie points.

Checked to make sure water was going to the fridge and it was. Removed the 1st line after the valve and no water was present. Figured the valve was bad. Removed the wires to the old valve and also had to remove the wire harness on the new valve. It wasn't needed. Replaced the valve and installed the old wires. Hooked up the water line and instantly had water. A day later I had a full ice bucket. This part wasn't listed on GE website. But it was on partselect.com.

The refrigerator was too warm. The drawers where vegetables and fruits are kept were being frozen. The vents blowing cool air into bins were iced up.
Took the drawers out of fridge and unscrewed the support rails for drawers and unscrewed inside back wall of fridge. Removed cover on blower fan ~ unplugged fan. This took 45 mins. Left refrigerator unplugged and let thaw out. Replaced with new fan 5 days later. Plugged in new fan. Then
Plugged in refrigerator to make sure it would work. After 15 minutes, unplugged fridge and put rails and drawers back. Total time 45 minutes. Plugged refrigerator back in and let run 24 hours.
It took 5 days to get part due to snow storm delaying delivery. It works perfectly. Our GE will be 10 years old in August.

Refrigerator not cooling, Freezer working fine
Frig area was at about 50 degrees and would not get cooler. Freezer was working great.
Empty the freezer and remove the two screws that hold the back panel of the inside of the freezer on. Pull the panel out and you will see the fan that is mounted to the back of the panel. If the fan is not running, disconnect it (quick connector) and check to see if there is voltage coming to it from the connector (should be 120VAC between the two wires). If there is power, and the fan was not working, replace the fan.

Fan just snaps into the holder on the back panel and plugs into the quick connector. Make sure you clear any ice build-up in the hole between the freezer and the frig that the fans blows through. Put it back together and verify the fan runs.

Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor Kit - 120V 60Hz

PartSelect Number PS3419839
Manufacturer Part Number 5303918549
The evaporator fan motor (Motor Evaporator Fan, Evaporator Fan Motor Kit, Evaporator Fan Motor, Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor) circulates air through the food compartment for efficient cooling in refrigerators. The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.

bottom of fridg. would not get cool. Temp was 50-60degrees. The freezer compartment worked so I knew it was not the compressor.
I removed the fan housing in the freezer section by removing all the screws. (7) There are two screws behind the vents. I did not have an ice maker to contend with so this was very easy. There is only two wires to disconnect....the ground wire and the electricity supply. Then you remove the unit from the back of the housing cover by removing two screws. Then the motor is removed from it's housing by removing 2 more screws. 1...2...3 and you're ready to reverse the procedure. I am not mechanically inclined and this was easy. Saved myself perhaps $120.00. Repair folks wanted mininum of $60.00 just to come out. Part and shipping cost me 33 bucks.OH, DON'T FORGET TO UNPLUG THE FRIDGE. :>)

My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!!
My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!! The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.

I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.

The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.

I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.

To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires, no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.

I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.

Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting.

This condenser fan motor kit includes a motor, fan blade, wire harness, and screws. Used in a refrigerator, the condenser fan motor moves the condenser fan blade to direct and move air across the condenser coil. Please note: The manufacturer has changed the appearance of the product from the original. The kit still functions the same as the original part. It is an OEM factory replacement. Make sure to unplug the refrigerator from the power source and wear gloves to protect your hands. Also, a helpful tip is to store food to prevent deterioration when the power is off.

Seven year old condenser fan was making noise when it was running.
The process to repair was very simple, I removed the back of the refrigerator to expose the motor area. I then removed three screws that held the condenser motor in place. once it was loose I detactched the electrical harness and removed the old motor. I then placed the new motor in place and secured it with the screws and reattached the new electrical harness that came with the new part. Once completed I reviewed it to make sure I didn't miss anything. I then replaced the cover over the motor area and enjoyed my success in repairing my own appliance with no added cost for labor, which would have been expensive I'm sure. The part purchased came with clear and consice instructions very easy to follow.

Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor

PartSelect Number PS12741350
Manufacturer Part Number WR60X31522
This 115-volt 60Hz evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer and circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated. If the motor has failed, the freezer/refrigerator will become too warm because the fan motor is not circulating the cool air from the freezer into the refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power to the appliance before starting your repair.

Freezer Fan
I removed two srews from the back panel inside fthe reezer compartment and the two that hold the air manifold/baffle? and pulled the baffle out. Then, I removed the two srews that hold the front part of the fan bracket behind the baffle and the back panel came out easily. Two more screws and one quick connect plug attached to the fan and I was done with removal. Insallation was even quicker, I slid the original fan right off the old motor and slid it on the new motor's shaft. Piece of cake! Thanks Partselect.

The Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor is an OEM replacement part for some GE refrigerators. It is responsible for circulating air over the evaporator coils, which are responsible for cooling the refrigerator's interior. Causes of a bad evaporator fan motor can include bearing failure, motor burnout due to overheating, or electrical issues. A malfunctioning fan motor can lead to temperature fluctuations, frost buildup, and ultimately, reduced cooling efficiency.

The refrigerator was too warm. The drawers where vegetables and fruits are kept were being frozen. The vents blowing cool air into bins were iced up.
Took the drawers out of fridge and unscrewed the support rails for drawers and unscrewed inside back wall of fridge. Removed cover on blower fan ~ unplugged fan. This took 45 mins. Left refrigerator unplugged and let thaw out. Replaced with new fan 5 days later. Plugged in new fan. Then
Plugged in refrigerator to make sure it would work. After 15 minutes, unplugged fridge and put rails and drawers back. Total time 45 minutes. Plugged refrigerator back in and let run 24 hours.
It took 5 days to get part due to snow storm delaying delivery. It works perfectly. Our GE will be 10 years old in August.

Evaporator Fan failure
The reason I repaired it myself was because the repairman that diagnosed the problem.didn't come back in two weeks. The evaporator fan sits behind a vented wall in the freezer and directs cold air into freezer and refrigerator.I removed the ice make assembly first and then the freezer wall held in place by two sheet metal nuts. Then removed wires from fan motor. Removed the fan blade from fan motor,which was press fitted on,then removed fan motor from bracket assembly(make sure and retain the two vibration rubber washers on back and front of motor. Reinstall new motor with vibration washers and press fan blade on new motor. Install in bracket assemble and reassemnble.

Refrigerator not cooling, Freezer working fine
Frig area was at about 50 degrees and would not get cooler. Freezer was working great.
Empty the freezer and remove the two screws that hold the back panel of the inside of the freezer on. Pull the panel out and you will see the fan that is mounted to the back of the panel. If the fan is not running, disconnect it (quick connector) and check to see if there is voltage coming to it from the connector (should be 120VAC between the two wires). If there is power, and the fan was not working, replace the fan.

Fan just snaps into the holder on the back panel and plugs into the quick connector. Make sure you clear any ice build-up in the hole between the freezer and the frig that the fans blows through. Put it back together and verify the fan runs.

PartSelect Number PS3419839
Manufacturer Part Number 5303918549
The evaporator fan motor (Motor Evaporator Fan, Evaporator Fan Motor Kit, Evaporator Fan Motor, Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor) circulates air through the food compartment for efficient cooling in refrigerators. The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.

bottom of fridg. would not get cool. Temp was 50-60degrees. The freezer compartment worked so I knew it was not the compressor.
I removed the fan housing in the freezer section by removing all the screws. (7) There are two screws behind the vents. I did not have an ice maker to contend with so this was very easy. There is only two wires to disconnect....the ground wire and the electricity supply. Then you remove the unit from the back of the housing cover by removing two screws. Then the motor is removed from it's housing by removing 2 more screws. 1...2...3 and you're ready to reverse the procedure. I am not mechanically inclined and this was easy. Saved myself perhaps $120.00. Repair folks wanted mininum of $60.00 just to come out. Part and shipping cost me 33 bucks.OH, DON'T FORGET TO UNPLUG THE FRIDGE. :>)

My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!!
My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!! The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.

I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.

The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.

I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.

To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires, no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.

I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.

Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting.

Please note: The manufacturer has changed the appearance of the product from the original. The kit still functions the same as the original part. It is an OEM factory replacement. Make sure to unplug the refrigerator from the power source and wear gloves to protect your hands. Also, a helpful tip is to store food to prevent deterioration when the power is off.

Seven year old condenser fan was making noise when it was running.
The process to repair was very simple, I removed the back of the refrigerator to expose the motor area. I then removed three screws that held the condenser motor in place. once it was loose I detactched the electrical harness and removed the old motor. I then placed the new motor in place and secured it with the screws and reattached the new electrical harness that came with the new part. Once completed I reviewed it to make sure I didn't miss anything. I then replaced the cover over the motor area and enjoyed my success in repairing my own appliance with no added cost for labor, which would have been expensive I'm sure. The part purchased came with clear and consice instructions very easy to follow.

Make sure to unplug the refrigerator from the power source and wear gloves to protect your hands. Also, a helpful tip is to store food to prevent deterioration when the power is off.

Installation Instructions
Josue from Jacksonville, NC
Seven year old condenser fan was making noise when it was running.
The process to repair was very simple, I removed the back of the refrigerator to expose the motor area. I then removed three screws that held the condenser motor in place. once it was loose I detactched the electrical harness and removed the old motor. I then placed the new motor in place and secured it with the screws and reattached the new electrical harness that came with the new part. Once completed I reviewed it to make sure I didn't miss anything. I then replaced the cover over the motor area and enjoyed my success in repairing my own appliance with no added cost for labor, which would have been expensive I'm sure. The part purchased came with clear and consice instructions very easy to follow.

PartSelect Number PS11723190
Manufacturer Part Number W10827015
This pantry drawer lid is also known as a pantry drawer door or pantry drawer cover. This is a genuine OEM part, and is sold individually. This part helps keep everything inside the drawer. It acts as a cover, and also keeps your drawer at the proper temperature by creating a seal. You may need to replace this part if door does not open or close, or if the drawer is too cold. No tools are required for this replacement, simply push the hinge pins aside to remove the old lid. Consider checking the pantry end cap kit for damage before ordering the pantry drawer lid, as they are often purchased together.

Installation Instructions
Chauncey from Menan, ID
Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Running but not cooling off and frost in the back of the freezer
Unplugged the refrigerator. Removed the 4 hex head screws on the lower back panel at the back of the freezer. Used a blow dryer to defrost the pipes and area surrounding the thermostat. Unplug the connection from the back of the freezer, unplug the 2 wires, one that goes to the heater, one that comes from power. Unclip the thermostat from the pipe and note which pipe you unclipped it from. Cut the wires on the old thermostat midway between the plugs and the sensor. Using the supplied butt connectors, strip the wire ends on color matched wires (should be a dark blue or black) and crimp them together. Repeat with the other wire. Discard the white shrink wrapping. I wasn't able to get it small enough with a hair dryer or lighter. Plug the thermostat back into it's respective plugs. Clip the thermostat back onto the pipe you removed it from. Replace the back panel with the four screws. Ensure the bottom of the panel is set inside of the drip tray. Replace any shelving you removed. Plug the refrigerator back into the wall. Your done!

PartSelect Number PS11739232
Manufacturer Part Number WP2198202
This thermostat assembly is used in refrigerator units and freezers as a sensor. The thermostat senses the temperature increase in the evaporator during the cycle of defrosting and turns off when ice is melted. If you have any of the following symptoms, replacing your thermostat could solve the problem: fridge does not start, is too warm, too cold, runs too long, or will not start. The tools needed for this repair project is a putty knife, Phillips and flat blade screw driver, 1/4 inch nut driver, and needle nose pliers. Remember to unplug refrigerator from power source as a safety precaution. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Refrigerator Defrost Thermostat

PartSelect Number PS1017716
Manufacturer Part Number WR50X10068
This defrost termination thermostat (Defrost Limiter Thermostat, High Limit Thermostat, Refrigerator Defrost Bi-Metal Thermostat) acts as a safety device to stop the evaporator coil from overheating, by turning off the defrost heater at the end of the defrost cycle. This part attaches to the tubing of the evaporator coil in the freezer. A faulty defrost termination thermostat may result in the defrost heater never heating and a solid frost buildup on the evaporator coil, which results in too warm temperatures. The thermostat contacts are normally closed and have continuity until it reaches 140 degrees. If this high limit thermostat is open at room temperature or colder, it is defective. This limit thermostat has an attached mounting clip and comes with pink and amber wire leads. The thermostat is 1 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch thick, the 2 wire leads are 10 inches long.

Ice box and freezer would not get cold,the back wall of the freezer was covered with ice
1. I had to defrost the ice off of the back wall of the freezer with a blowdryer.
2. Removed the four 1/4'' screws and removed the back panel.
3. Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.
4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.
The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.
Thank You.

Bruce from Alton, IL
Refrigerator would not run but interior light was on.
I unplugged the refrigerator, then opened the door and removed four screws holding the plastic electrical panel to the interior top of the main refrigerator compartment and noticed the cold control was corroded badly, apparently from moisture in the panel. I ordered a new one from partselect.com. When it arrived the next day, I then pulled off the control knob, unclipped the cold control, unplugged the three wires to the control, then removed the styrofoam insulation blocks holding the thermocouple wire and then removed the thermocouple wire to complete the removal. I then reversed the process to install the new thermostat and control. That is repositioned the thermocouple wire, put the insulation blocks back to hold the wire, then replugged the three electrical wires, clipped the control back and pushed the control knob back on and finally screwed the panel back to the top of the main compartment and plugged the refrigerator electrical cord back in to provide current to the refrigerator. It immediately started up and ran fine. Total time - about 8 minutes.

PartSelect Number PS11750673
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10225581
If you have ice building up in your freezer, or if your freezer is getting too warm during the defrost cycle you may need to replace the bi-metal defrost thermostat. The function of the defrost bi-metal thermostat is to clip onto the evaporator and protect your evaporator from overheating during the defrost cycle. If your refrigerator does not defrost properly you can test both the thermostat and the heater to figure out which part is at fault. For this repair, you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a 1/4 inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, a pair of wire strippers, a roll of electrical tape, and a few butt splice connectors.

PartSelect Number PS8746718
Manufacturer Part Number 242303001
This authentic OEM damper control assembly is designed to be compatible with refrigerators. The assembly regulates the airflow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. When the refrigerator needs to cool down, the damper receives signals from the thermostat or control board to open and allows more cold air from the freezer to enter the refrigerator compartment. When the desired temperature is reached, the damper closes to restrict airflow. If the damper assembly is faulty or damaged, your fridge will be unable to maintain the desired temperature levels. It may be either too warm leading to food spoilage or too cold leading to frost buildup.

Fridge side warm.
Removed the nut screws holding on the controls on the fridge side. Swapped out the old damper control for the new. Just need to be sure to get the new assembly in the same way the old one came out -- including placement of the freezer sensor control (separate part from the assembly). Replaced the control unit and damper worked and now my fridge is the right temperature! One other item -- when diagnosing the problem with a warm fridge, most newer fridges have a self testing method via the digital temperature controls. Find your Service Data Sheet for instructions. This would have saved me time from using my multimeter testing various components.

Annoying sound from the fan control motor
Removed the grill and control cover in the top middle of the main compartment, removed the control, unplugged it and put in the new one. The thing that took the longest was figuring out that this was the part that needed replacing. The fridge is less than two years old and about 6 months ago the control started making these odd noises. Now it's quiet. Ah peace!

I took out the plate that covers the evaporator in the freezer with 3/8 nut driver. I removed the clips holding on the fan cover and used the pliers to take the fan off the old motor. I then took the old motor out, affixed the fan to the new motor and replaced the motor and fan assembly. I reassembled the entire fan assembly and reinstalled the evaporator plate

Leo from Bentonville, AR
Running but not cooling off and frost in the back of the freezer
Unplugged the refrigerator. Removed the 4 hex head screws on the lower back panel at the back of the freezer. Used a blow dryer to defrost the pipes and area surrounding the thermostat. Unplug the connection from the back of the freezer, unplug the 2 wires, one that goes to the heater, one that comes from power. Unclip the thermostat from the pipe and note which pipe you unclipped it from. Cut the wires on the old thermostat midway between the plugs and the sensor. Using the supplied butt connectors, strip the wire ends on color matched wires (should be a dark blue or black) and crimp them together. Repeat with the other wire. Discard the white shrink wrapping. I wasn't able to get it small enough with a hair dryer or lighter. Plug the thermostat back into it's respective plugs. Clip the thermostat back onto the pipe you removed it from. Replace the back panel with the four screws. Ensure the bottom of the panel is set inside of the drip tray. Replace any shelving you removed. Plug the refrigerator back into the wall. Your done!

freezer would not defrost
My freezer would freeze up and not allow cold air to refrigerator side. First I took off bottom face plate, located the timer on left side bottom, removed the two screws and unpluged the timer. Replaced the timer with new one. Second I removed all food from freezer. Took of back of freezer wall with nut driver. Located the thermostat which was very easy to remove. Just one clip holding thermostat. Unplugged the two wires from the old thermostat and plugged in new wires. Thanks to Partselect.com, the parts were an exact match. Very easy to do. Saved my tons of money. Freezer and refer works like new.

PartSelect Number PS11739232

This thermostat assembly is used in refrigerator units and freezers as a sensor. The thermostat senses the temperature increase in the evaporator during the cycle of defrosting and turns off when ice is melted. If you have any of the following symptoms, replacing your thermostat could solve the problem: fridge does not start, is too warm, too cold, runs too long, or will not start. The tools needed for this repair project is a putty knife, Phillips and flat blade screw driver, 1/4 inch nut driver, and needle nose pliers. Remember to unplug refrigerator from power source as a safety precaution. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

inconsistent compressor and condensor fan operation
Compressor start relay would cycle several times before compressor would come on. Replaced start relay and defrost timer assy. Operated more consistently however not completely reliable. Ice would begin to melt. Noticed that if you would cycle the temperature control the compressor would start again and operate for several hours then not cycle again. Jumpered temp control and operation was continuous and reliable. Replaced cold control thermostat. Operation now normal. Suspect high resistance in switch caused start relay and timer contacts to arc. Small amount of carbon noticed under temp control...

Refrigerator Defrost Thermostat

18 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS1017716
Manufacturer Part Number WR50X10068
This defrost termination thermostat (Defrost Limiter Thermostat, High Limit Thermostat, Refrigerator Defrost Bi-Metal Thermostat) acts as a safety device to stop the evaporator coil from overheating, by turning off the defrost heater at the end of the defrost cycle. This part attaches to the tubing of the evaporator coil in the freezer. A faulty defrost termination thermostat may result in the defrost heater never heating and a solid frost buildup on the evaporator coil, which results in too warm temperatures. The thermostat contacts are normally closed and have continuity until it reaches 140 degrees. If this high limit thermostat is open at room temperature or colder, it is defective. This limit thermostat has an attached mounting clip and comes with pink and amber wire leads. The thermostat is 1 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch thick, the 2 wire leads are 10 inches long.

Greg from Aledo, TX
Ice box and freezer would not get cold,the back wall of the freezer was covered with ice
1. I had to defrost the ice off of the back wall of the freezer with a blowdryer.
2. Removed the four 1/4'' screws and removed the back panel.
3. Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.
4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.
The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.
Thank You.

Bruce from Alton, IL
Refrigerator would not run but interior light was on.
I unplugged the refrigerator, then opened the door and removed four screws holding the plastic electrical panel to the interior top of the main refrigerator compartment and noticed the cold control was corroded badly, apparently from moisture in the panel. I ordered a new one from partselect.com. When it arrived the next day, I then pulled off the control knob, unclipped the cold control, unplugged the three wires to the control, then removed the styrofoam insulation blocks holding the thermocouple wire and then removed the thermocouple wire to complete the removal. I then reversed the process to install the new thermostat and control. That is repositioned the thermocouple wire, put the insulation blocks back to hold the wire, then replugged the three electrical wires, clipped the control back and pushed the control knob back on and finally screwed the panel back to the top of the main compartment and plugged the refrigerator electrical cord back in to provide current to the refrigerator. It immediately started up and ran fine. Total time - about 8 minutes.

PartSelect Number PS11750673
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10225581
If you have ice building up in your freezer, or if your freezer is getting too warm during the defrost cycle you may need to replace the bi-metal defrost thermostat. The function of the defrost bi-metal thermostat is to clip onto the evaporator and protect your evaporator from overheating during the defrost cycle. If your refrigerator does not defrost properly you can test both the thermostat and the heater to figure out which part is at fault. For this repair, you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a 1/4 inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, a pair of wire strippers, a roll of electrical tape, and a few butt splice connectors.

Refrigerator Damper Control Assembly
★★★★★

17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746718
Manufacturer Part Number 242303001
This authentic OEM damper control assembly is designed to be compatible with refrigerators. The assembly regulates the airflow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. When the refrigerator needs to cool down, the damper receives signals from the thermostat or control board to open and allows more cold air from the freezer to enter the refrigerator compartment. When the desired temperature is reached, the damper closes to restrict airflow. If the damper assembly is faulty or damaged, your fridge will be unable to maintain the desired temperature levels. It may be either too warm leading to food spoilage or too cold leading to frost buildup.

Lyman from LEXINGTON, KY
Fridge side warm.
Removed the nut screws holding on the controls on the fridge side. Swapped out the old damper control for the new. Just need to be sure to get the new assembly in the same way the old one came out -- including placement of the freezer sensor control (separate part from the assembly). Replaced the control unit and damper worked and now my fridge is the right temperature! One other item -- when diagnosing the problem with a warm fridge, most newer fridges have a self testing method via the digital temperature controls. Find your Service Data Sheet for instructions. This would have saved me time from using my multimeter testing various components.

This was the second part I tried. The defrost timer was first, but that did not fix it. To do this I had to remove the ice maker and the back plate of the freezer.

Annoying sound from the fan control motor
Removed the grill and control cover in the top middle of the main compartment, removed the control, unplugged it and put in the new one. The thing that took the longest was figuring out that this was the part that needed replacing. The fridge is less than two years old and about 6 months ago the control started making these odd noises. Now it's quiet. Ah peace!

David from Fleetwood, PA
Freezer / refrigerator warm (not defrosting)
I checked the defrost timer (bottom front of the freezer / outside). I advanced it to send it into the defrost cycle. The heating elements in the freezer (behind the panel) did not heat up. I cut the wires going to the defrost thermostat. Turned the power back on, made sure the defrost timer was still in the defrost cycle and checked the voltage at the wires to the defrost thermostat (before the heating elements). There was power / voltage there. I jumped out / bypassed the defrost thermostat turned the power back on and the heating elements came on. The problem was the defrost thermostat. So I replaced it with a new one from PartSelect.com. How it works...
When the defrost timer is advanced to the defrost cycle the switch closes sending power to the defrost thermostat. If the temperature is low enough, the defrost thermostat switch will close and sends power to the heating elements. When the temperature rises high enough about 55 degrees the switch at the thermostat will open and the heating elements will turn off (not allowing the freezer temperature to get too high, just enough to defrost the coil). The refrigerator will turn back on when the timer advances. The defrost timer will defrost every 8-12 hours.

The door shelf end cap, or door bin support, secures the rack in a refrigerator or freezer door. Note that this fits on either the left or right hand side. If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.

Lynn from New York,, NY
My electric bill was super high. $450 for 1 month for a 1bdrm apt in NY city
I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order. Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws. There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors. I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable.

The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step. They were easy to swap out. You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws. There are alot of them. You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest. Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place. Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws. Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work. You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy. I never even broke a nail.

The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure. They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them. (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it. I will have it in case I need it in the future)

My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made. Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable. I can afford my electric bill now. Thanks for your help.

PartSelect Number PS16729788
Manufacturer Part Number WR71X38307
This door shelf bin is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for refrigerators. It is made of highly durable clear plastic, which allows users to easily view the contents of the bin. The bin is a storage compartment used to hold various items such as bottles, jars, and condiments. It provides a convenient way to store and organize food items for easy access. The bin is vulnerable to breakage, discoloration, and warping over time. The bin may also fail due to overloading or accidental impacts. Do not place any items in the bin if it is damaged as this may result in accidental spills and damage to the interior components of the refrigerator. No mounting hardware is needed for this repair.

Refrigerator Door Shelf End Cap - Left or Right Side

PartSelect Number PS422444
Manufacturer Part Number 215267701
This end cap can be used for the right or left side of the refrigerator door shelf or the freezer door shelf. It is white in color, made of plastic material and measures about 2 inches high by 3 inches deep. This might need to be replaced if it has broken or worn over time. This repair requires no tools. You will need to open your fridge, pull upwards on the existing end cap, and pull outwards. There is a locking tab on either end so it does not matter if the top or bottom comes out first. Slide the new end cap onto the rail and it is installed.
Installation Instructions
David from Fleetwood, PA
Freezer / refrigerator warm (not defrosting)
I checked the defrost timer (bottom front of the freezer / outside). I advanced it to send it into the defrost cycle. The heating elements in the freezer (behind the panel) did not heat up. I cut the wires going to the defrost thermostat. Turned the power back on, made sure the defrost timer was still in the defrost cycle and checked the voltage at the wires to the defrost thermostat (before the heating elements). There was power / voltage there. I jumped out / bypassed the defrost thermostat turned the power back on and the heating elements came on. The problem was the defrost thermostat. So I replaced it with a new one from PartSelect.com. How it works...
When the defrost timer is advanced to the defrost cycle the switch closes sending power to the defrost thermostat. If the temperature is low enough, the defrost thermostat switch will close and sends power to the heating elements. When the temperature rises high enough about 55 degrees the switch at the thermostat will open and the heating elements will turn off (not allowing the freezer temperature to get too high, just enough to defrost the coil). The refrigerator will turn back on when the timer advances. The defrost timer will defrost every 8-12 hours.

The door shelf end cap, or door bin support, secures the rack in a refrigerator or freezer door. Note that this fits on either the left or right hand side. If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.

My electric bill was super high. $450 for 1 month for a 1bdrm apt in NY city
I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order. Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws. There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors. I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable.

The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step. They were easy to swap out. You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws. There are alot of them. You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest. Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place. Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws. Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work. You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy. I never even broke a nail.

The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure. They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them. (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it. I will have it in case I need it in the future)

My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made. Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable. I can afford my electric bill now. Thanks for your help.

The door shelf retainer bar end cap connects to the retainer bar on your refrigerator’s door shelf, and attaches it to the refrigerator door. If your shelf retainer bar has become disconnected, a damaged end cap could be the cause. To remove the end cap, first unhook the release tab on both ends of the retainer bar. Slide out the bar and the end caps, and slide out the defective cap. Now, simply replace the end cap and snap the bar with end caps back in place on the refrigerator door. This part is made of white plastic and is sold individually.

This crisper pan roller is sourced directly from the manufacturer for use in your refrigerator. It is a genuine OEM part that is designed to fit just like the original for your convenience. The roller is a plastic wheel-like component that attached to the sides of the crisper pan and allows it slide in and out of the refrigerator smoothly. The rollers allow users to easily and conveniently access the contents of the drawers. Over time, the roller may wear down, break, or fall off. If the roller is faulty, you may notice difficulty sliding the drawer in and out, or the drawer may feel loose and unstable when you pull it out. Each crisper pan roller is sold individually. Ensure that you order the correct number of rollers for your refrigerator.

Roller screw recipients broke out. Can't be repaired.
Was not able to repair. Wasn't rollers I needed. Plastic screw recipients in front on frame had broken out so rollers weren't the problem. Tried gluing back pieces to no avail. Crisper frames are poorly designed.

top dw rack fell off of rollers
Amazingly, this not-too-old dishwasher's plastic parts that hold the top rack onto the sliders became brittle (a real design flaw, in my opinion) and the tabs that held the rollers in place all broke off. With the right parts and the great instructions on this site, the repair was fairly easy and we saved a lot of $$ by not having to call for service. Just follow the instructions...

This is a drawer roller for the freezer compartment of your LG refrigerator. This roller is made of white plastic, and acts as a wheel to allow the drawer to glide smoothly back and forth when you open and close the freezer compartment. Over time and with further frequent use, this roller can crack, break, or stop rolling smoothly, at which point it will need replacing. Your refrigerator comes with two rollers, and this roller is sold individually, so consider how many rollers you require before ordering.

PartSelect Number PS11770473
Manufacturer Part Number 5304506469
This Refrigerator Handle set comes in 2 pieces, and measures roughly 17"" in length. It can be installed with a screwdriver to allow the door to be opened and closed. If your handle is visibly broken then it should be replaced. Refer to your model number, and user manual to see if this part is right for you. These door handles are not sold individually, so we recommend replacing both handles at one time, or keeping the second one as a spare in case of future repairs. If you require the mounting blocks for the handle, these are sold separately. To make the repair, simply remove the screws at the top of the lower door, and replace the handle, screwing it into place.

This white handle can be used with both the freezer door and the fresh food door of many refrigerators. Note: As per the manufacturer, this handle includes the mounting block and screw for the top of the handle. If you need the screw for the bottom, it must be ordered separately.

Take your new handle and use your screwdriver to position back into place.

Arles from RADCLIFF, KY
Handle Broke next to screws because improperly tightened at installation to switch handles
Removed the old handles with a phillips bit and 20V drill for freezer handle. Popped out plug with screwdriver on bottom screw of refrigerator handle and used star bit for this one screw on refrigerator door handle and phillips for other 2 screws. Positioned handles one at a time on proper door and then manually tightened all the screws with phillips screwdriver so as to not crack the handles. Used the 20V drill set on a torque setting for the star screw. After screws were in, i then put in the new screw cover over the one screw on refrigerator door and I was finished.

★★★★★

146 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11770473
Manufacturer Part Number 5304506469
This Refrigerator Handle set comes in 2 pieces, and measures roughly 17"" in length. It can be installed with a screwdriver to allow the door to be opened and closed. If your handle is visibly broken then it should be replaced. Refer to your model number, and user manual to see if this part is right for you. These door handles are not sold individually, so we recommend replacing both handles at one time, or keeping the second one as a spare in case of future repairs. If you require the mounting blocks for the handle, these are sold separately. To make the repair, simply remove the screws at the top of the lower door, and replace the handle, screwing it into place.

This white handle can be used with both the freezer door and the fresh food door of many refrigerators. Note: As per the manufacturer, this handle includes the mounting block and screw for the top of the handle. If you need the screw for the bottom, it must be ordered separately.

Take your new handle and use your screwdriver to position back into place.

Arles from RADCLIFF, KY
Handle Broke next to screws because improperly tightened at installation to switch handles
Removed the old handles with a phillips bit and 20V drill for freezer handle. Popped out plug with screwdriver on bottom screw of refrigerator handle and used star bit for this one screw on refrigerator door handle and phillips for other 2 screws. Positioned handles one at a time on proper door and then manually tightened all the screws with phillips screwdriver so as to not crack the handles. Used the 20V drill set on a torque setting for the star screw. After screws were in, i then put in the new screw cover over the one screw on refrigerator door and I was finished.

Internal water lines brittle, cracked, leaking
First of all, the larger white plastic tubes in this thing are 5/16"" OD, which no plumbing store seems to stock. At the lower left rear end there are 2 tubes, one for water and one for ice, that are doomed to fail being in proximity of a heat source - they essentially get cooked to the point of becoming brittle and cracking. The smaller tube and union can be easily found, but do yourself a favor if the larger one cracks and order the plastic tube and water tube union here, and just cut off the brittle part and amend the old tube using the union.

It is typically located at the back of the refrigerator, where it runs from the water inlet valve to the ice maker assembly.

The fill tube is an essential component of the ice maker system, ensuring a steady supply of water for ice production.

water dispenser started leaking
i wasn't sure it was the inlet valve unit because the leak was at the water dispenser in the freezer door. after some research it looked like the water inlet valve located in the back lower part of the refrigerator was the problem. to replace, take off the cardboard cover, about 6 screws, you have access to the water inlet valve, disconnect the hoses (i think it goes without saying that you should have turned off the water to the frig) replace the inlet valve, connect hoses, turn water back on and you'll be back in business. very easy repair.

water dispenser started leaking
i wasn't sure it was the inlet valve unit because the leak was at the water dispenser in the freezer door. after some research it looked like the water inlet valve located in the back lower part of the refrigerator was the problem. to replace, take off the cardboard cover, about 6 screws, you have access to the water inlet valve, disconnect the hoses (i think it goes without saying that you should have turned off the water to the frig) replace the inlet valve, connect hoses, turn water back on and you'll be back in business. very easy repair.

Marty from West Bloomfield, MI
Internal water lines brittle, cracked, leaking
First of all, the larger white plastic tubes in this thing are 5/16"" OD, which no plumbing store seems to stock. At the lower left rear end there are 2 tubes, one for water and one for ice, that are doomed to fail being in proximity of a heat source - they essentially get cooked to the point of becoming brittle and cracking. The smaller tube and union can be easily found, but do yourself a favor if the larger one cracks and order the plastic tube and water tube union here, and just cut off the brittle part and amend the old tube using the union.

Refrigerator TUBE-WATER
★★★★★

6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12745424
Manufacturer Part Number W11415785
This water fill tube is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with various models of refrigerator. It is a small plastic tube that supplies water to the ice maker tray. It is typically located at the back of the refrigerator, where it runs from the water inlet valve to the ice maker assembly. When the ice maker needs to produce ice, water flows through this tube and fills the ice maker tray, where it freezes into ice cubes. The fill tube is an essential component of the ice maker system, ensuring a steady supply of water for ice production. If the fill tube becomes clogged or damaged, it can water leaks inside the refrigerator and also lead to difficulties producing ice when needed.

This is a replacement mullion rail for your French door-style refrigerator. You will typically find the mullion rail on the left side refrigerator door. The mullion rail helps to keep the refrigerator door closed. If the door will not close properly or if you notice leaking on your floor, you may need to replace the door mullion. A faulty mullion can gather moisture, resulting in a leak. To replace the mullion, simply disconnect the old mullion from the wire harness and unscrew it. Re-attach the wire harness to the mullion and screw it back into place.

I had several broken appilances broken with parts to be replaced.
I had ordered the parts from Part Select and came with in a week. I ahd a Whrilpool microwave that had a door panel and vent grille that needed to be replaced and that was rplced with ease took less that five minutes to do. My Maytag refridgerator had it kickplate grille replace along with the pivot block that took all of about two minutes. The longest job that took about 5 minutes was my Whirlpool glass oven door that needed to be replaced, but that was pretty ease to replace also with an extra hand from my son. I just didn't want to break another glass door or I would have done it myself plus I was teaching him how to do self reparts.

Richard from West Alton, MO
Freezer was still simi-cold but refrigerator was not.
Called a friend that lead me down the right path so i did a search for the part's and found this site. The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

Ice box and freezer would not get cold,the back wall of the freezer was covered with ice
1. I had to defrost the ice off of the back wall of the freezer with a blowdryer.
2. Removed the four 1/4'' screws and removed the back panel.
3. Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.
4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.
The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.
Thank You.

Refrigerator would not go into Defrost
When I first noticed that my refrigerator coil was iced up, I read a little bit about the defrost cycle of a refrigerator. I decided to try replacing the least expensive parts first. First I tried the defrost themostat, it was a very easy repair. My coil still froze up after a couple of days. Then I learned how to force my fridge into a defrost mode (on a frigidaire you just click the light button in the fridge 5 times in under 6 seconds). Then I noticed that the defrost heater was not heating up...this repair was more difficult. You have to first remove the two shelves, bin, and tracks. Then you remove the back panel...4 screws. Then you have to take out a couple of screws and drill out one rivet on the drain pan and pull the drain pan out so you can get the defrost heater which snakes up through the coil from the bottom of the coil. Be careful, as the drain pan and coil fins are very sharp, I sliced a couple fingers messing around with these parts. The defrost heater itself is relatively easy to put in once the coil is in the right position (there are videos on youtube on how to do this). After I put in the new heating element, and buttoned everything back up, I was excited to check my work...I forced the fridge into defrost by clicking the light switch 5 times, and the heater still didn't come on! It dawned on me that this problem started about 5 days after a major power outage (hurricane Irene)...When the power came on, it must have surged, and zapped the defrost control board...Long story short, I replaced the control board (about $75.00 from partselect.com) and my problem is fixed...at least I have a 100% brand new defrost system now...Of course it won't be too long until my wife wants another fridge to match her Stainless Steel applicances...oh well, this one will do fine in the garage.

Scott from Pratt, KS
Freezer cold, but Refrigerator not cooling. Iced up coils.
After determining that it was the defrost system, I ordered the thermostat. Make sure you look closely. Mine had two thermostats, and so I had to wait a couple of days for the extra part.
1. Remove ice maker if installed.
2. Remove center casing on ceiling and back wall. There may be two screws that need removed.
3. Locate and remove two screws on upper back wall.
4. Remove back wall carefully, revealing coil system.
5. If this was the problem, the coils will be iced over and need thawed. Either time or a hair dryer...
6. The thermostats clip onto the copper tubing, simply pull them off, keeping close attention to the color of the wires.
7. Be very careful touching the bottom of the coils as the defrost conductor coils are along the bottom and encased in easily breakable glass. If you need to replace this as well, remove the center brace (wire)by pulling towards you and then down. remove wire attachments at both ends and rotate coil out of end braces.
8. Replacing thermostats...you must CUT the wires, and attach new thermostats with wire couplers or wire nuts and then wrap with electrical tape that is rated for the cold.
9. Re-attach all parts and replace back wall and coverings.
10. Enjoy!

Then I learned how to force my fridge into a defrost mode (on a frigidaire you just click the light button in the fridge 5 times in under 6 seconds). Then I noticed that the defrost heater was not heating up...this repair was more difficult. You have to first remove the two shelves, bin, and tracks. Then you remove the back panel...4 screws. Then you have to take out a couple of screws and drill out one rivet on the drain pan and pull the drain pan out so you can get the defrost heater which snakes up through the coil from the bottom of the coil. Be careful, as the drain pan and coil fins are very sharp, I sliced a couple fingers messing around with these parts. The defrost heater itself is relatively easy to put in once the coil is in the right position (there are videos on youtube on how to do this). After I put in the new heating element, and buttoned everything back up, I was excited to check my work...I forced the fridge into defrost by clicking the light switch 5 times, and the heater still didn't come on! It dawned on me that this problem started about 5 days after a major power outage (hurricane Irene)...When the power came on, it must have surged, and zapped the defrost control board...Long story short, I replaced the control board (about $75.00 from partselect.com) and my problem is fixed...at least I have a 100% brand new defrost system now...Of course it won't be too long until my wife wants another fridge to match her Stainless Steel applicances...oh well, this one will do fine in the garage.

Freezer cold, but Refrigerator not cooling. Iced up coils.
After determining that it was the defrost system, I ordered the thermostat. Make sure you look closely. Mine had two thermostats, and so I had to wait a couple of days for the extra part.
1. Remove ice maker if installed.
2. Remove center casing on ceiling and back wall. There may be two screws that need removed.
3. Locate and remove two screws on upper back wall.
4. Remove back wall carefully, revealing coil system.
5. If this was the problem, the coils will be iced over and need thawed. Either time or a hair dryer...
6. The thermostats clip onto the copper tubing, simply pull them off, keeping close attention to the color of the wires.
7. Be very careful touching the bottom of the coils as the defrost conductor coils are along the bottom and encased in easily breakable glass. If you need to replace this as well, remove the center brace (wire)by pulling towards you and then down. remove wire attachments at both ends and rotate coil out of end braces.
8. Replacing thermostats...you must CUT the wires, and attach new thermostats with wire couplers or wire nuts and then wrap with electrical tape that is rated for the cold.
9. Re-attach all parts and replace back wall and coverings.
10. Enjoy!

Freezer was still simi-cold but refrigerator was not.
Called a friend that lead me down the right path so i did a search for the part's and found this site. The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

Ice box and freezer would not get cold,the back wall of the freezer was covered with ice
1. I had to defrost the ice off of the back wall of the freezer with a blowdryer.
2. Removed the four 1/4'' screws and removed the back panel.
3. Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.
4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.
The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.
Thank You.

Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★
★★★★★
43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Freezer is cold, Refridgerator is not as cold as it should be
Having seen this problem before in other equipment so I had an idea where to look. Problem: the automatic defrost function was not operating. Looking through openings in the back panel of the freezer compartment, you could see the evaporator coils and fins were a solid chuck of ice. There are three logical components to check. Heater element, thermostat (located just above the evaporator) and a relay on the control board (located in the fridge control panel). Checked the heater with an ohm meter -- OK. The thermostat closes the circuit at around 20 degrees and opens at around 32 degrees. Pulled out the thermostat, wiring, fan unit. Everything unplugs, unscrews, and unclips, don't cut wires. Put the whole assembly in a friends freezer for an hour or so to see if the thermostat closes -- OK. Problem had to be with the control board. Replaced control board, reprogrammed it per included instruction. Everything is working again.

This 2-plug LED light control board is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for refrigerators. It fits into the fresh food section of the refrigerator. The LED light helps users easily see the contents of the fridge, even in low-light conditions. LED lights are a popular choice due to their energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and ability to produce bright and consistent lighting. Compared to traditional incandescent or fluorescent lights, LED lights consume less energy, generate less heat, and have a much longer operational lifespan, making them a preferred choice-

Edward from UNIVERSITY PL, WA
Central light board flashed periodically then quit
I began by replacing the central light board by using a plastic non-marring wedge type tool slipping it between the housing and the retainers to release the latch like catch. Then I removed the lightboard and light cover assembly by depressing the latch like retainers for the two wire connectors. Installation was as simple as snapping the wires into the connectors and then pushing the lightboard and light cover assembly into place. One major note: I learned from a repairman that you cannot resolve the problem by simply replacing the central lightboard. you must replace all three lightboards, the two in the refrigerator and the one in the freezer because unless you can absolutely identify which board is causing the fault, it will continue to cause a problem on the main board and the lights will not work. Replacing the other two boards is the same as the central board. Additional comment to consider: I absolutely fail top see how this design of using three circuit boards for a simple light saves me anything; in fact after only 5 years it has cost me in excess of $400 (or 20% of the original cost of the unit) just in materials for a simple light--absurd, ridiculous design. If it burns out again I will have an appliance repairman install a simple 1950's design switch a small LED bulb which will probably last longer than the unit.

Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.

Freezer Freezing up and blocking the vent for refrigerator, not cooling the fridge.
Went pretty straight forward, except the heat shrink tubing was about 2 sizes too big. Would not shrink small enough to seal the connections. Even with a heat gun it would not shrink small enough. OH, another think is when I plugged the fridge back in the defrost timer was in defrost mode. Took me a few minutes to figure that out and use a screwdriver to turn the timer back to the on position. Other than that, install was pretty simple.

This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

Refrigerator would warm up while freezer got colder
Repair man thought it was the control board and an issue with a relay on the board. Purchased the new board but found out the board was fine, and it was the recirculating fan that would go out intermediately.

Tried ordering that part from Part Select since they have been great, but GE discontinued the part and their was not a replacement available. After much research, found the new replacement part number and ordered that, it went in quickly and for now seems to have solved the problem.

Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★
★★★★★
43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Freezer is cold, Refridgerator is not as cold as it should be
Having seen this problem before in other equipment so I had an idea where to look. Problem: the automatic defrost function was not operating. Looking through openings in the back panel of the freezer compartment, you could see the evaporator coils and fins were a solid chuck of ice. There are three logical components to check. Heater element, thermostat (located just above the evaporator) and a relay on the control board (located in the fridge control panel). Checked the heater with an ohm meter -- OK. The thermostat closes the circuit at around 20 degrees and opens at around 32 degrees. Pulled out the thermostat, wiring, fan unit. Everything unplugs, unscrews, and unclips, don't cut wires. Put the whole assembly in a friends freezer for an hour or so to see if the thermostat closes -- OK. Problem had to be with the control board. Replaced control board, reprogrammed it per included instruction. Everything is working again.

Edward from UNIVERSITY PL, WA
Central light board flashed periodically then quit
I began by replacing the central light board by using a plastic non-marring wedge type tool slipping it between the housing and the retainers to release the latch like catch. Then I removed the lightboard and light cover assembly by depressing the latch like retainers for the two wire connectors. Installation was as simple as snapping the wires into the connectors and then pushing the lightboard and light cover assembly into place. One major note: I learned from a repairman that you cannot resolve the problem by simply replacing the central lightboard. you must replace all three lightboards, the two in the refrigerator and the one in the freezer because unless you can absolutely identify which board is causing the fault, it will continue to cause a problem on the main board and the lights will not work. Replacing the other two boards is the same as the central board. Additional comment to consider: I absolutely fail top see how this design of using three circuit boards for a simple light saves me anything; in fact after only 5 years it has cost me in excess of $400 (or 20% of the original cost of the unit) just in materials for a simple light--absurd, ridiculous design. If it burns out again I will have an appliance repairman install a simple 1950's design switch a small LED bulb which will probably last longer than the unit.

The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

PartSelect Number PS423802
Manufacturer Part Number 215846604
This defrost timer is designed for use in your refrigerator. The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.

Freezer Freezing up and blocking the vent for refrigerator, not cooling the fridge.
Went pretty straight forward, except the heat shrink tubing was about 2 sizes too big. Would not shrink small enough to seal the connections. Even with a heat gun it would not shrink small enough. OH, another think is when I plugged the fridge back in the defrost timer was in defrost mode. Took me a few minutes to figure that out and use a screwdriver to turn the timer back to the on position. Other than that, install was pretty simple.

This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.

Freezer Freezing up and blocking the vent for refrigerator, not cooling the fridge.
Went pretty straight forward, except the heat shrink tubing was about 2 sizes too big. Would not shrink small enough to seal the connections. Even with a heat gun it would not shrink small enough. OH, another think is when I plugged the fridge back in the defrost timer was in defrost mode. Took me a few minutes to figure that out and use a screwdriver to turn the timer back to the on position. Other than that, install was pretty simple.

PartSelect Number PS310869
Manufacturer Part Number WR9X502
This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

Freezer was still simi-cold but refrigerator was not.
Called a friend that lead me down the right path so i did a search for the part's and found this site. The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

Refrigerator would warm up while freezer got colder
Repair man thought it was the control board and an issue with a relay on the board. Purchased the new board but found out the board was fine, and it was the recirculating fan that would go out intermediately.

Tried ordering that part from Part Select since they have been great, but GE discontinued the part and their was not a replacement available. After much research, found the new replacement part number and ordered that, it went in quickly and for now seems to have solved the problem.

Refrigerator Dispenser Door Assembly or Flapper
★★★★★
★★★★★
93 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS964304
Manufacturer Part Number WR17X11653
This “Dispenser Door Assembly” (Door Recess Assembly, Ice Door Assembly, Dispenser Door, Refrigerator Dispenser Ice Chute Door Kit, Dispenser Door Flap, Ice Chute Door, Flapper) keeps the room air from infiltrating the freezer. Once the lever is pressed, the door flap opens and allows the ice to dispense into your container. If your door flapper is broken, it could allow outside air to enter the freezer and alter the inside temperature. You may notice frost buildup surrounding the dispenser area. The door flap can disconnect from the dispenser lever, or the tabs that hold it in place may break. Frequent use may distort the sealing face and cause air leaks and frost buildup. This part mounts in the ice dispenser, and measures approximately 3.25 inches in diameter. It is constructed of plastic and rubber, and comes in white/black. This part is sold individually.

ALBERT from RALEIGH, NC
Our Ice Damper was warped, which let warm air into the freezer and caused frost to form. Also, our ice and water dispensers stopped working.
Swapping out the ice dispenser damper door was pretty easy- just used a combination of screwdrivers to remove the dispenser assembly, popped the old damper off, put the new damper on. Replacing the control board was only a bit more complicated- unplugged the fridge, removed the control board metal cover (beware the somewhat sharp edges), unhooked all the cables from the board, used needle-nose pliers to pinch each plastic spacer/fastener as to not damage them while removing the old board, mounted the new board where the old board was, and plugged in all the cables (they were all different enough from each other that I didn't have any trouble figuring out where they were supposed to connect). I now have my fridge plugged into a surge protector- hopefully that will protect this new board I've installed. Thanks a bunch,PartSelect.

Water actuator broke
If you think you probably can't do this, you're like me... but you just had to try because you needed the part anyway right? This really was quite simple, a lot easier than it sounds from the description and saved me probably $75 I'd have had to pay a tech to do it. Just unplug fridge, yank that water spill tray out, yes yank, it's a bit hard to do that if you've not done it before. After that remove the 3 phillips head screws you just gained access to. Lift panel frame up then out. Disconnect wire harness plug and set that frame aside. Take out next screws exposed to free the unit. Tilt unit out and remove the two little screws and shims holding actuator in place. Remove broken one. Put new one in. Reverse all actions taken thus far. Plug fridge back in and have a drink of water like nothing ever happened. : ) You can do this!

Customjer service rep was helpful and pleasant, though the replacements shelves did not bear the Kitchenaid Logo or frosted scheme on glass shelves (I requested and was informed that the replacement shelves would match my Superbra) - Otherwise, parts, when available, were shipped and arrived in well packaged boxes and not damaged. Parts were cheaper than Kitchenaid, though I would call Kitchenaid first to inquire about matching parts prior to ordering from partselect, if that matters to the buyer...Matching shelves may not in fact be available from manufacturer due to age of appliance.

Water dispenser actuator snapped in half
Unplugged refrigerator. Pull forward on tray at bottom of water & ice dispenser to remove it. Remove three screws. Push up and then pull out to remove black cover around dispensers. Be careful not to break ribbon cable. Pulled ribbon cable from green circuit card on the cover. Set the cover aside. Removed green circuit card from refigerator (six small screws). Had to unplug two wires to do this. Set this aside. Make sure you remember which connector each wire goes in for re-assembly. I ended up removing the entire assembly, it was easier to work on. There were a couple more screws to remove and then you can carefully pull the entire assembly down and toward you to remove it. This meant removing the water supply line from the dispenser. Pushed up on the water supply line with needle nose pliers to ""unstick"" it and make it easier to pull out. Used needle nose pliers to unplug wires from broken actuator from the circuit card. Make sure to unplug the correct one. Unscrewed the two screws that held the metal plates thet held the actuator in place. Cut the wires to make it easier to remove the broken actuator and pull the wires through Installed the new actuator and screws. Routed the wire through and plugged it in to the circuit card. Now the hardest part, and I would not have figured it out without a tip from this website. There was no slack in the water line and it was impossible to push the end of it back into the hole in the dispenser assembly. Open the refrigerator doors and remove the black cover at the bottom. The water line goes up through the freezer door from the bottom. It was easy to push an inch or two of slack up through the door. Then I could grab the water line and insert it in the hole in the dispenser. Re-connect the wires that were disconnected and replace the assembly in the freezer door. You can pull slack in the water supply line back down from the bottom if needed. Replace the screws that hold the dispenser assembly in place. Replace the circuit card. Then I had to push the ribbon cable back into the slot in the circuit card in the cover. I had to remove the circuit card from the cover to get at the slot. Push the cable into the slot and re-install the circuit card in the cover. I needed to have my son help me here as a second set of hands was needed, the ribbon cable is short. Replace the cover, be careful not to damage the ribbon cable. Install the three screws and snap the boittom tray back in place. Re-install the black cover at the bottom. Works great.

Water dispenser not working, Ice dispenser chute icing up
I removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover following directions I found on-line (push down and gently pry out at the bottom). I then removed several nut-head screws which were holding a plastic plate which had the door light and electric control wiring mounted in it. Behind that I found a broken tab on the Control Bracket which was why my water dispencer was not working and I found the chute door for the ice maker was chewed up which allowed warm air into the chute and was causing my ice build up problem. Replacing the Control Bracket was easy. Just note how things come apart. Putting the chute door in was a little more complicated, but again, note how things come apart and you should not have a problem putting it back together.

Refrigerator Dispenser Door Assembly or Flapper
★★★★★
★★★★★
93 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS964304
Manufacturer Part Number WR17X11653
This “Dispenser Door Assembly” (Door Recess Assembly, Ice Door Assembly, Dispenser Door, Refrigerator Dispenser Ice Chute Door Kit, Dispenser Door Flap, Ice Chute Door, Flapper) keeps the room air from infiltrating the freezer. Once the lever is pressed, the door flap opens and allows the ice to dispense into your container. If your door flapper is broken, it could allow outside air to enter the freezer and alter the inside temperature. You may notice frost buildup surrounding the dispenser area. The door flap can disconnect from the dispenser lever, or the tabs that hold it in place may break. Frequent use may distort the sealing face and cause air leaks and frost buildup. This part mounts in the ice dispenser, and measures approximately 3.25 inches in diameter. It is constructed of plastic and rubber, and comes in white/black. This part is sold individually.

ALBERT from RALEIGH, NC
Our Ice Damper was warped, which let warm air into the freezer and caused frost to form. Also, our ice and water dispensers stopped working.
Swapping out the ice dispenser damper door was pretty easy- just used a combination of screwdrivers to remove the dispenser assembly, popped the old damper off, put the new damper on. Replacing the control board was only a bit more complicated- unplugged the fridge, removed the control board metal cover (beware the somewhat sharp edges), unhooked all the cables from the board, used needle-nose pliers to pinch each plastic spacer/fastener as to not damage them while removing the old board, mounted the new board where the old board was, and plugged in all the cables (they were all different enough from each other that I didn't have any trouble figuring out where they were supposed to connect). I now have my fridge plugged into a surge protector- hopefully that will protect this new board I've installed. Thanks a bunch,PartSelect.

Water actuator broke
If you think you probably can't do this, you're like me... but you just had to try because you needed the part anyway right? This really was quite simple, a lot easier than it sounds from the description and saved me probably $75 I'd have had to pay a tech to do it. Just unplug fridge, yank that water spill tray out, yes yank, it's a bit hard to do that if you've not done it before. After that remove the 3 phillips head screws you just gained access to. Lift panel frame up then out. Disconnect wire harness plug and set that frame aside. Take out next screws exposed to free the unit. Tilt unit out and remove the two little screws and shims holding actuator in place. Remove broken one. Put new one in. Reverse all actions taken thus far. Plug fridge back in and have a drink of water like nothing ever happened. : ) You can do this!

I had to remove everything inside including the surrounding box and disconnect all the wire connector s. The solenoid that was bad was behind the cover that the auger motor cover. . Job was easy after I determined I had to remove everything that was not attached to the back wall.

Kitchenaid refrigerator shelf frames were cracking, needed replacement
I had to purchase two shelves and adjustable brackets - though I only needed the slidign glass shelves . Customjer service rep was helpful and pleasant, though the replacements shelves did not bear the Kitchenaid Logo or frosted scheme on glass shelves (I requested and was informed that the replacement shelves would match my Superbra) - Otherwise, parts, when available, were shipped and arrived in well packaged boxes and not damaged. Parts were cheaper than Kitchenaid, though I would call Kitchenaid first to inquire about matching parts prior to ordering from partselect, if that matters to the buyer...Matching shelves may not in fact be available from manufacturer due to age of appliance.

Jerome from Yardville, NJ
Water dispenser actuator snapped in half
Unplugged refrigerator. Pull forward on tray at bottom of water & ice dispenser to remove it. Remove three screws. Push up and then pull out to remove black cover around dispensers. Be careful not to break ribbon cable. Pulled ribbon cable from green circuit card on the cover. Set the cover aside. Removed green circuit card from refigerator (six small screws). Had to unplug two wires to do this. Set this aside. Make sure you remember which connector each wire goes in for re-assembly. I ended up removing the entire assembly, it was easier to work on. There were a couple more screws to remove and then you can carefully pull the entire assembly down and toward you to remove it. This meant removing the water supply line from the dispenser. Pushed up on the water supply line with needle nose pliers to ""unstick"" it and make it easier to pull out. Used needle nose pliers to unplug wires from broken actuator from the circuit card. Make sure to unplug the correct one. Unscrewed the two screws that held the metal plates thet held the actuator in place. Cut the wires to make it easier to remove the broken actuator and pull the wires through Installed the new actuator and screws. Routed the wire through and plugged it in to the circuit card. Now the hardest part, and I would not have figured it out without a tip from this website. There was no slack in the water line and it was impossible to push the end of it back into the hole in the dispenser assembly. Open the refrigerator doors and remove the black cover at the bottom. The water line goes up through the freezer door from the bottom. It was easy to push an inch or two of slack up through the door. Then I could grab the water line and insert it in the hole in the dispenser. Re-connect the wires that were disconnected and replace the assembly in the freezer door. You can pull slack in the water supply line back down from the bottom if needed. Replace the screws that hold the dispenser assembly in place. Replace the circuit card. Then I had to push the ribbon cable back into the slot in the circuit card in the cover. I had to remove the circuit card from the cover to get at the slot. Push the cable into the slot and re-install the circuit card in the cover. I needed to have my son help me here as a second set of hands was needed, the ribbon cable is short. Replace the cover, be careful not to damage the ribbon cable. Install the three screws and snap the boittom tray back in place. Re-install the black cover at the bottom. Works great.

Water dispenser not working, Ice dispenser chute icing up
I removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover following directions I found on-line (push down and gently pry out at the bottom). I then removed several nut-head screws which were holding a plastic plate which had the door light and electric control wiring mounted in it. Behind that I found a broken tab on the Control Bracket which was why my water dispencer was not working and I found the chute door for the ice maker was chewed up which allowed warm air into the chute and was causing my ice build up problem. Replacing the Control Bracket was easy. Just note how things come apart. Putting the chute door in was a little more complicated, but again, note how things come apart and you should not have a problem putting it back together.

After getting wiring diagram off internet it was diagnosed as freezer stuck in defrost mode, temp alarm on, but fan running.
Turned gray knob on defrost timer (located bottom left back of freezer) past defrost position to verify compressor would run...it would not, but fan would run. Tested run capacitor...found borderline defective (weak, wrong value ohm meter kick). Just to be sure, removed interior shelves and interior rear and gasket to check heater at 20 ohms as OK and removed thermostat and verified contact closure after exposure in another freezer....re-installed, hooked heater back up and re-installed interior rear panel. Replaced defrost timer by unplugging 4-pin connector, then removed 2 screws that hold it to the bracket. Installed new one in reverse order. Then removed wire bail holding run capacitor to compressor plug assembly, removed run capacitor, plugged in new one. Turned on freezer......now making ice and holding cold temperature and cycling properly between freeze and defrost modes. Two problems made this repair a bit more difficult. This is the second time that defrost timer has failed...only got 3 years from last one.

PartSelect Number PS11757023

This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer. You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy. Replacing the run capacitor is a relatively easy project. For this repair you will only need a 1/4 inch nut driver and needle nose pliers. Remember to disconnect the power and water supply line to the unit before you begin this repair. For full step by step instructions, simply click on the video below.

Jim Meeks from Wimberly, TX
The controller (current relay) burned up
1. Unhooked a retaining wire that secures the controller to the compressor terminal box. 2. removed destroyed part. 3. Got the model and serial numbers and got online. 4. Ordered part 5. Waited a couple of weeks to get part 6. Found that the manufacturer had daisy chained a bunch of components together with some funny deep socket plugs that by themselves are not routinely found so rather than buy a laundry list of unnecessary parts to get the aforementioned plus and make my customer wait a couple of more weeks I chose to connect the wires to a couple of high temperature female stainless steel quick connectors and feed the wires directly into the controller. Fortunately the controller had the polarity marked on the housing. (L for Line was the hot lead and C was for common the neutral lead) Failure to follow proper polarity will damage the part and could kill the compressors's start wimding.

Ken from HOLLAND, MI
Compressor would not run. My daughter was told that compressor was bad and needed to be replaced. Cost would be $550 labor plus parts. I could hear a clicking sound I believe was made by the starter relay. I ordered the parts from part select and had them in three days.
I took the screws out of back panel and slid water line and panel off to the right side while I removed the capacitor and starter relay. Relay was probably the only problem, but I replaced capacitor too while I was doing the repair. Finished removal and replacement in about 20 minutes. While I had panel off I cleaned coils that I could see from behind and then did the same on front side. Cost was $136 for both parts. I could have done it for $71 if I did not replace the capacitor too. Saved my daughter from being taken advantage of.

No power to the fan and compressor
I have a fridge in my garage. I have found that a glass of ice water or a cold drink outside is very important to me. When I discovered melting ice dripping onto the garage floor I was very upset. I spun the fridge and found that the compressor and fan weren't starting. I got out my multi-meter and discovered that power was not making it to these components. I did some research and found the wiring diagram online. There really isn't too much going on with a fridge and the most likely candidate seemed to be the run capacitor. I ordered the part, replaced it in a few minutes and the fridge began working again.

This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Faulty Controller and Possibly Capacitor
After building a test box and determining the Controller was bad simply ordered parts and installed. Installation was a little difficult due to locking spades on electrical connections.

Unplug all power from freezer. Remove Bail wire from controller capacitor unit and remove from compressor by pulling STRAIGHT from compressor body to avoid bending contacts.

Use a very small instrumentation screwdriver to release locking spade on yellow and white wires. To unlock slide screwdriver in slot along wire entry to controller body while gently pulling on wire. Note position of wires and replace on new unit in same position/order. Plug new run capacitor into new controller being careful to orient capacitor to proper position (hole matches guide on controller unit). Plug newly installed controller and capacitor into condensor and replace bail wire.

Make sure timer is not in defrost mode - manually advance timer if necessary to ensure timer is in run mode. Turn temperature control to coldest setting. Plug in and hopefully enjoy the humming noise of your newly repaired and operational compressor and freezer.

I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer. You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy. Replacing the run capacitor is a relatively easy project. For this repair you will only need a 1/4 inch nut driver and needle nose pliers. Remember to disconnect the power and water supply line to the unit before you begin this repair. For full step by step instructions, simply click on the video below.

The controller (current relay) burned up
1. Unhooked a retaining wire that secures the controller to the compressor terminal box. 2. removed destroyed part. 3. Got the model and serial numbers and got online. 4. Ordered part 5. Waited a couple of weeks to get part 6. Found that the manufacturer had daisy chained a bunch of components together with some funny deep socket plugs that by themselves are not routinely found so rather than buy a laundry list of unnecessary parts to get the aforementioned plus and make my customer wait a couple of more weeks I chose to connect the wires to a couple of high temperature female stainless steel quick connectors and feed the wires directly into the controller. Fortunately the controller had the polarity marked on the housing. (L for Line was the hot lead and C was for common the neutral lead) Failure to follow proper polarity will damage the part and could kill the compressors's start wimding.

Compressor would not run. My daughter was told that compressor was bad and needed to be replaced. Cost would be $550 labor plus parts. I could hear a clicking sound I believe was made by the starter relay. I ordered the parts from part select and had them in three days.
I took the screws out of back panel and slid water line and panel off to the right side while I removed the capacitor and starter relay. Relay was probably the only problem, but I replaced capacitor too while I was doing the repair. Finished removal and replacement in about 20 minutes. While I had panel off I cleaned coils that I could see from behind and then did the same on front side. Cost was $136 for both parts. I could have done it for $71 if I did not replace the capacitor too. Saved my daughter from being taken advantage of.

No power to the fan and compressor
I have a fridge in my garage. I have found that a glass of ice water or a cold drink outside is very important to me. When I discovered melting ice dripping onto the garage floor I was very upset. I spun the fridge and found that the compressor and fan weren't starting. I got out my multi-meter and discovered that power was not making it to these components. I did some research and found the wiring diagram online. There really isn't too much going on with a fridge and the most likely candidate seemed to be the run capacitor. I ordered the part, replaced it in a few minutes and the fridge began working again.

This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Faulty Controller and Possibly Capacitor
After building a test box and determining the Controller was bad simply ordered parts and installed. Installation was a little difficult due to locking spades on electrical connections.

Unplug all power from freezer. Remove Bail wire from controller capacitor unit and remove from compressor by pulling STRAIGHT from compressor body to avoid bending contacts.

Use a very small instrumentation screwdriver to release locking spade on yellow and white wires. To unlock slide screwdriver in slot along wire entry to controller body while gently pulling on wire. Note position of wires and replace on new unit in same position/order. Plug new run capacitor into new controller being careful to orient capacitor to proper position (hole matches guide on controller unit). Plug newly installed controller and capacitor into condensor and replace bail wire.

Make sure timer is not in defrost mode - manually advance timer if necessary to ensure timer is in run mode. Turn temperature control to coldest setting. Plug in and hopefully enjoy the humming noise of your newly repaired and operational compressor and freezer.

After getting wiring diagram off internet it was diagnosed as freezer stuck in defrost mode, temp alarm on, but fan running.
Turned gray knob on defrost timer (located bottom left back of freezer) past defrost position to verify compressor would run...it would not, but fan would run. Tested run capacitor...found borderline defective (weak, wrong value ohm meter kick). Just to be sure, removed interior shelves and interior rear and gasket to check heater at 20 ohms as OK and removed thermostat and verified contact closure after exposure in another freezer....re-installed, hooked heater back up and re-installed interior rear panel. Replaced defrost timer by unplugging 4-pin connector, then removed 2 screws that hold it to the bracket. Installed new one in reverse order. Then removed wire bail holding run capacitor to compressor plug assembly, removed run capacitor, plugged in new one. Turned on freezer......now making ice and holding cold temperature and cycling properly between freeze and defrost modes. Two problems made this repair a bit more difficult. This is the second time that defrost timer has failed...only got 3 years from last one.

Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

Fridge too warm, evaporator icing up
After replacing the defrost heater, main board and thermistor I still had the same problem. Called a repair guy and he (with the help of GE on the phone) diagnosed that the temperature sensor was bad. So I ordered from partselect and installed it and it fixed the problem. Been good for a couple months (knocking on wood). To install I had to cut the 2 wires to the old sensor, crimp the 2 new wires on and snap the new sensor to the clip on the evaporator. Very easy. Make sure you seal the ends of the wire crimps so moisture doesn't get in and corrode the connection.

PartSelect Number PS11741429
Manufacturer Part Number WP338906
If your gas dryer is not heating up or igniting, then replacing the flame sensor, located in the burner assembly, could solve it. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.

Michael from Kirkwood, MO
Gas Dryer would not ignite
1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.
2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.
3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.
4. removed two wires and screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.
5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.
6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.
7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.
8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.
9. Carefully and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on.
10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out.
11.Replaced the black vent plastic.
12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.
13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite.
14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure.
15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!

Evaporator frozen (refrigrator section) and allowing top section to lose cooling
This is the Samsung French door refrigerator style that so many people have complained about freezing up and not cooling the top section. I first changed out the defrost thermostat and this did not correct the problem. I done a quick resistance check on the temp sensor that's mounted on the evaporator itself. The resistance would change when holding an ice cube on the sensor so I just assumed it was ok. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: When performing a resistance check on this sensor, make sure your readings match the Samsung temp/resistance chart in their literature. My sensor was way off calibration and was causing the freeze up. Its working as designed now and DW is happy again. Learn from my mistake.

This temperature sensor is for refrigerators. The temperature sensor senses the temperature inside the refrigerator and sends information to the electronic control. Unplug the refrigerator and safely store any food that could deteriorate while the power is off before installing this part. Wear work gloves to protect your hands. The thermistor itself, part WPW10383615, should test at these Ohms depending on temperature. It's recommended to test at room temperature and again in a glass of ice water to make sure it's sensing temperatures properly. So it should read around 3000 - 5000 Ohms at room temperature 7000 - 10000 Ohms at 0°C and 20000 Ohms at -15°C.

This long harness thermistor kit is what helps monitor and regulate the temperature inside your refrigerator. It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.

Freezer cold, refrigerator warm
Overload relay accessible from back, by compressor unit. Very easy to change out. Diagram from your site placed defrost thermostat in same area.It wasn't. Found another diagram, showed it in refrigerator light area, took that apart, not there. Yet another diagram showed it in the duct work area at back of refrigerator cabinet. Not there. Finally removed back of freezer compartment, found thermistor and thermostat with the fins. Clipped wires, wired in parts, quick fix. Longest amount of time was spent finding the old parts to replace them. Actual replacement took less than 15 minutes. Refrigerator holding at 35 degrees set on 2 now, better than ever. Total cost, less than $120, doing iy ourselves....priceless.

My fridge temp was warm. Freezer temp was ok, but fluctuated some.
I checked the dampener, it worked. The compressor and fan worked. I knew because my freezer was still hovering around 10 degrees. Coils were clean. Thermistor was the only thing it could be. Took all my shelves out. Removed four screws. Took the back panel off. The thermistor sits tucked in on the side. I piped it out, in clipped it. Used my multimeter to test the numbers. Numbers were off just a bit. Ordered the part. Crossed my fingers.,took less then 5 minutes to put the part in. Plugged in the fridge. It was sitting at 33 degrees in about an hour and a half. I can’t believe I fixed it. I knew NOTHING about refrigerators. For how big my fridge is, it would have cost 3,000 and up to get a new one with the same cu ft size. Instead, it cost me $44. That includes shipping. Thank you Parts Select!! Made it so easy to pick the correct part for my model fridge!

This sensor (Temperature Sensor, Thermistor, Refrigerator Temperature Sensor) sends the temperature reading of the compartment to the control board. If you notice your refrigerator is too warm, too cold, or not defrosting properly, then there may be a problem with your sensor. The temperature sensor can break from material fatigue or through normal use, and should be replaced. It is attached to the evaporator and control housing in your appliance. It measures approximately 1.25 inches long with 18 inch wire leads, and is constructed out of plastic. This part comes in white, beige. It includes the sensor, with wire leads.

Fridge too warm, evaporator icing up
After replacing the defrost heater, main board and thermistor I still had the same problem. Called a repair guy and he (with the help of GE on the phone) diagnosed that the temperature sensor was bad. So I ordered from partselect and installed it and it fixed the problem. Been good for a couple months (knocking on wood). To install I had to cut the 2 wires to the old sensor, crimp the 2 new wires on and snap the new sensor to the clip on the evaporator. Very easy. Make sure you seal the ends of the wire crimps so moisture doesn't get in and corrode the connection.

Refrigerator Dryer Radiant Flame Sensor

12 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11741429
Manufacturer Part Number WP338906
If your gas dryer is not heating up or igniting, then replacing the flame sensor, located in the burner assembly, could solve it. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.

Installation Instructions
Michael from Kirkwood, MO
Gas Dryer would not ignite
1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.
2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.
3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.
4. removed two wires and screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.
5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.
6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.
7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.
8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.
9. Carefully and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on.
10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out.
11.Replaced the black vent plastic.
12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.
13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite.
14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure.
15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!

Evaporator frozen (refrigrator section) and allowing top section to lose cooling
This is the Samsung French door refrigerator style that so many people have complained about freezing up and not cooling the top section. I first changed out the defrost thermostat and this did not correct the problem. I done a quick resistance check on the temp sensor that's mounted on the evaporator itself. The resistance would change when holding an ice cube on the sensor so I just assumed it was ok. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: When performing a resistance check on this sensor, make sure your readings match the Samsung temp/resistance chart in their literature. My sensor was way off calibration and was causing the freeze up. Its working as designed now and DW is happy again. Learn from my mistake.

This temperature sensor is for refrigerators. The temperature sensor senses the temperature inside the refrigerator and sends information to the electronic control. Unplug the refrigerator and safely store any food that could deteriorate while the power is off before installing this part. Wear work gloves to protect your hands. The thermistor itself, part WPW10383615, should test at these Ohms depending on temperature. It's recommended to test at room temperature and again in a glass of ice water to make sure it's sensing temperatures properly. So it should read around 3000 - 5000 Ohms at room temperature 7000 - 10000 Ohms at 0°C and 20000 Ohms at -15°C.

If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.

Gordon from Ben Wheeler, TX
Freezer cold, refrigerator warm
Overload relay accessible from back, by compressor unit. Very easy to change out. Diagram from your site placed defrost thermostat in same area.It wasn't. Found another diagram, showed it in refrigerator light area, took that apart, not there. Yet another diagram showed it in the duct work area at back of refrigerator cabinet. Not there. Finally removed back of freezer compartment, found thermistor and thermostat with the fins. Clipped wires, wired in parts, quick fix. Longest amount of time was spent finding the old parts to replace them. Actual replacement took less than 15 minutes. Refrigerator holding at 35 degrees set on 2 now, better than ever. Total cost, less than $120, doing iy ourselves....priceless.

This temperature sensor, also known as a thermistor, is responsible for preventing the evaporator within your refrigerator from overheating during its defrosting cycle. This sensor is compatible with various makes and models of refrigerator and is sold as an individual part. This sensor works with the electronic control board within your refrigerator to control the temperature by turning the compressor on or off. If your fridge is too warm or too cold, consider changing the thermistor with this genuine OEM part, and make sure to disconnect the power to the refrigerator before doing any repairs.

Cindy from AMARILLO, TX
My fridge temp was warm. Freezer temp was ok, but fluctuated some.
I checked the dampener, it worked. The compressor and fan worked. I knew because my freezer was still hovering around 10 degrees. Coils were clean. Thermistor was the only thing it could be. Took all my shelves out. Removed four screws. Took the back panel off. The thermistor sits tucked in on the side. I piped it out, in clipped it. Used my multimeter to test the numbers. Numbers were off just a bit. Ordered the part. Crossed my fingers.,took less then 5 minutes to put the part in. Plugged in the fridge. It was sitting at 33 degrees in about an hour and a half. I can’t believe I fixed it. I knew NOTHING about refrigerators. For how big my fridge is, it would have cost 3,000 and up to get a new one with the same cu ft size. Instead, it cost me $44. That includes shipping. Thank you Parts Select!! Made it so easy to pick the correct part for my model fridge!

Noisy fan
1. Removed the 7 nuts using the nut driver from the freezer back panel inside the freezer.
2. Remove the back panel. The evaporator motor and fan are located above the coils.
3. Unplug the wiring harness.
4. Remove the two gold mounting screws holding the motor and fan in place.
5. Remove the motor and fan including the brackets.
6. Install the new motor and fan onto the mounting bracket.
6a. Attach the green ground to the mounting bracket.
7. Screw the two gold screws back into the freezer.
8. Attach the new wiring harness. Note, the old harness had a mounting hole/space for it to connect to the wiring harness of the freezer. The new motor's harness was not long enough for this, so it is connected freely to the freezer harness.
9. Use the hair dryer to melt any ice that may have formed on the coils and hole where the fan goes.
10. Turn the freezer on to see if the fan turns on.
11. Reinstall the back panel.
All done!

Broke a blade off of the fan
When cleaning the coils on your refrigerator always remember rule number 1, unplug it first. I was cleaning the coils and hit the fan blade while it was moving with a brush, thus breaking off one of the fan blades. I ordered a new fan and installed it in about 15 minutes. Very easy repair.

My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!!
My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!! The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.

I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.

The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.

I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.

To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires, no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.

I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.

Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting.

Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

No cool in lower refrigerator
I’m a technician,I was contacted by a customer. After listening to the customers issue I determine the freezer evaporator fan was bad. Real easy job loosen the hex head screws on top of the ice maker and pull it straight up. Disconnect ice maker wiring harness.remove the two top 1/4” screws that hold the back cover on and pull it forward. Disconnect your wiring harness and remove the whole back panel. Lay the back panel face down on the floor and remove two metal clips that are up at the top with a flat head screwdriver. Center plastic panel slides up and out maybe necessary to take a flat head screwdriver to the very top to release the plastic clip. Pull your fan blade off. On the backside of the motor just take and twist the flat plastic piece counterclockwise and remove your motor and install the new one Reassemble in the opposite order.

Jordan from Maumee, OH
Noisy fan
1. Removed the 7 nuts using the nut driver from the freezer back panel inside the freezer.
2. Remove the back panel. The evaporator motor and fan are located above the coils.
3. Unplug the wiring harness.
4. Remove the two gold mounting screws holding the motor and fan in place.
5. Remove the motor and fan including the brackets.
6. Install the new motor and fan onto the mounting bracket.
6a. Attach the green ground to the mounting bracket.
7. Screw the two gold screws back into the freezer.
8. Attach the new wiring harness. Note, the old harness had a mounting hole/space for it to connect to the wiring harness of the freezer. The new motor's harness was not long enough for this, so it is connected freely to the freezer harness.
9. Use the hair dryer to melt any ice that may have formed on the coils and hole where the fan goes.
10. Turn the freezer on to see if the fan turns on.
11. Reinstall the back panel.
All done!

Milton from Camp Hill, PA
Broke a blade off of the fan
When cleaning the coils on your refrigerator always remember rule number 1, unplug it first. I was cleaning the coils and hit the fan blade while it was moving with a brush, thus breaking off one of the fan blades. I ordered a new fan and installed it in about 15 minutes. Very easy repair.

The fan blade is made of white plastic and is approximately 6 inches in diameter.

Jeffrey from Tampa, FL
My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!!
My refrigerator began to overheat and the everything was thawing!! The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.

I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.

The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.

I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.

To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires, no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.

I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.

Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting.

CYNTHIA from ALPHARETTA, GA
Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

No cool in lower refrigerator
I’m a technician,I was contacted by a customer. After listening to the customers issue I determine the freezer evaporator fan was bad. Real easy job loosen the hex head screws on top of the ice maker and pull it straight up. Disconnect ice maker wiring harness.remove the two top 1/4” screws that hold the back cover on and pull it forward. Disconnect your wiring harness and remove the whole back panel. Lay the back panel face down on the floor and remove two metal clips that are up at the top with a flat head screwdriver. Center plastic panel slides up and out maybe necessary to take a flat head screwdriver to the very top to release the plastic clip. Pull your fan blade off. On the backside of the motor just take and twist the flat plastic piece counterclockwise and remove your motor and install the new one Reassemble in the opposite order.

This evaporator fan blade is for your refrigerator, and it circulates air so that the temperature of the fridge is regulated. This model has 3 blades, and is a little more than 4 inches in diameter. It is made of white plastic and is sold individually. If your refrigerator is noisy and you hear a clicking sound, it is a good indication that the evaporator fan blade is warped or damaged. If the fridge or freezer sections become too warm, the fan could be to blame as well.

PartSelect Number PS12585793
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518034
This is a 120 volt defrost timer manufactured for refrigerators. The defrost timer manages the automatic defrost systemin the unit. It acts like a clock by switching between activating the cooling cycle and the defrost heater to maintain the set thermostat temperature, preventing the unit from being too warm or cold. The defrost timer may need to be replaced if the fridge will not maintain its temperature or has frost buildup. Depending on the model, it could be located on the rear panel or ceiling of the fresh food compartment. Be sure to disconnect power to the refrigerator before replacing this part.

James from Navarre, FL
After getting wiring diagram off internet it was diagnosed as freezer stuck in defrost mode, temp alarm on, but fan running.
Turned gray knob on defrost timer (located bottom left back of freezer) past defrost position to verify compressor would run...it would not, but fan would run. Tested run capacitor...found borderline defective (weak, wrong value ohm meter kick). Just to be sure, removed interior shelves and interior rear and gasket to check heater at 20 ohms as OK and removed thermostat and verified contact closure after exposure in another freezer....re-installed, hooked heater back up and re-installed interior rear panel. Replaced defrost timer by unplugging 4-pin connector, then removed 2 screws that hold it to the bracket. Installed new one in reverse order. Then removed wire bail holding run capacitor to compressor plug assembly, removed run capacitor, plugged in new one. Turned on freezer......now making ice and holding cold temperature and cycling properly between freeze and defrost modes. Two problems made this repair a bit more difficult. This is the second time that defrost timer has failed...only got 3 years from last one.

Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★
★★★★★
43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

This defrost timer is designed for use in your refrigerator. The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.

Freezer Freezing up and blocking the vent for refrigerator, not cooling the fridge.
Went pretty straight forward, except the heat shrink tubing was about 2 sizes too big. Would not shrink small enough to seal the connections. Even with a heat gun it would not shrink small enough. OH, another think is when I plugged the fridge back in the defrost timer was in defrost mode. Took me a few minutes to figure that out and use a screwdriver to turn the timer back to the on position. Other than that, install was pretty simple.

This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

Freezer was still simi-cold but refrigerator was not.
Called a friend that lead me down the right path so i did a search for the part's and found this site. The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

Fridge and freezer didn't cool enough
I diagnosed the problem via the internet. Diagrams helped a lot. Coils were frozen over. Thawed them out overnight. Manually advanced timer and the defrost heater was operable. The defrost timer wasn't ""turning"" on it's own. I turned the fridge back on while I awaited the part. It worked fine for the time I had to wait. (over two weeks since I had delayed ordering the part) New timer arrived as promised. Undid 4 hex head (1/4"") screws. Unplugged 4 prong connection. Plugged in new timer and replaced the 4 screws. Frigde works great.

Freezer on side by side fridge would freeze up and stop refrigerator from working
The defrost timer was mounted in refridgerator by the temp. control. Just two mounting screws to remove. Tested this part as discribed in trouble shooting section. It needed to be replaced. Also found the defrost elements behind the rear wall of freezer, they were the glass tube type one was clearly blown. The freezer coils were a solid block of ice. No way the air could flow into refridgerator part. used a hair dryer to defrost also used a thicker wire ot unclog the drian that leads to pan under fridge. this one had two glass tube heaters that wear held in with two screws each. just unplug wires. I also replaced the thermostat since it was right there and it was the only other part listed that could cause the freeze up. bottom line its like i have a brand new side by side fridge. These kind are like $1500 to replace. So for $99 in parts and and hour or work I got my fridge back. Thanks for your help and getting the right parts here in just a couple of days.

I diagnosed the problem via the internet. Diagrams helped a lot. Coils were frozen over. Thawed them out overnight. Manually advanced timer and the defrost heater was operable. The defrost timer wasn't ""turning"" on it's own. I turned the fridge back on while I awaited the part. It worked fine for the time I had to wait. (over two weeks since I had delayed ordering the part) New timer arrived as promised. Undid 4 hex head (1/4"") screws. Unplugged 4 prong connection. Plugged in new timer and replaced the 4 screws. Frigde works great.

Freezer on side by side fridge would freeze up and stop refrigerator from working
The defrost timer was mounted in refridgerator by the temp. control. Just two mounting screws to remove. Tested this part as discribed in trouble shooting section. It needed to be replaced. Also found the defrost elements behind the rear wall of freezer, they were the glass tube type one was clearly blown. The freezer coils were a solid block of ice. No way the air could flow into refridgerator part. used a hair dryer to defrost also used a thicker wire ot unclog the drian that leads to pan under fridge. this one had two glass tube heaters that wear held in with two screws each. just unplug wires. I also replaced the thermostat since it was right there and it was the only other part listed that could cause the freeze up. bottom line its like i have a brand new side by side fridge. These kind are like $1500 to replace. So for $99 in parts and and hour or work I got my fridge back. Thanks for your help and getting the right parts here in just a couple of days.

PartSelect Number PS12585793
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518034
This is a 120 volt defrost timer manufactured for refrigerators. The defrost timer manages the automatic defrost systemin the unit. It acts like a clock by switching between activating the cooling cycle and the defrost heater to maintain the set thermostat temperature, preventing the unit from being too warm or cold. The defrost timer may need to be replaced if the fridge will not maintain its temperature or has frost buildup. Depending on the model, it could be located on the rear panel or ceiling of the fresh food compartment. Be sure to disconnect power to the refrigerator before replacing this part.

James from Navarre, FL
After getting wiring diagram off internet it was diagnosed as freezer stuck in defrost mode, temp alarm on, but fan running.
Turned gray knob on defrost timer (located bottom left back of freezer) past defrost position to verify compressor would run...it would not, but fan would run. Tested run capacitor...found borderline defective (weak, wrong value ohm meter kick). Just to be sure, removed interior shelves and interior rear and gasket to check heater at 20 ohms as OK and removed thermostat and verified contact closure after exposure in another freezer....re-installed, hooked heater back up and re-installed interior rear panel. Replaced defrost timer by unplugging 4-pin connector, then removed 2 screws that hold it to the bracket. Installed new one in reverse order. Then removed wire bail holding run capacitor to compressor plug assembly, removed run capacitor, plugged in new one. Turned on freezer......now making ice and holding cold temperature and cycling properly between freeze and defrost modes. Two problems made this repair a bit more difficult. This is the second time that defrost timer has failed...only got 3 years from last one.

Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★

43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

PartSelect Number PS423802
Manufacturer Part Number 215846604
This defrost timer is designed for use in your refrigerator. The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.

Freezer Freezing up and blocking the vent for refrigerator, not cooling the fridge.
Went pretty straight forward, except the heat shrink tubing was about 2 sizes too big. Would not shrink small enough to seal the connections. Even with a heat gun it would not shrink small enough. OH, another think is when I plugged the fridge back in the defrost timer was in defrost mode. Took me a few minutes to figure that out and use a screwdriver to turn the timer back to the on position. Other than that, install was pretty simple.

This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

Freezer was still simi-cold but refrigerator was not.
Called a friend that lead me down the right path so i did a search for the part's and found this site. The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck.

This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

Gilbert from Clinton, MO
The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

MARK from LIBERTY LAKE, WA
Rear of upper shelf would freeze, while the rest of the freezer was dripping wet
We opened our freezer last week only to find the bottom 2/3 was barely cold, while only the rear of the upper shelf was cold. In fact, it was covered in frost, despite being a frost-free model. Our frozen veggies were slushy, not rock hard, and our frozen juices were all liquid. We defrosted the freezer, plugged it back in, but immediately noticed that we didn't hear the 'whhoooooosh' that you typically hear when you close the freezer door. After 30 minutes, the rear upper shelf was frosty again, but the rest was still at room temp. We figured the freezer was a goner, so we started looking at new freezers. I headed online to see if I could fix it, and I eventually found this site. I had learned online that these symptoms can be caused by either a bad capacitor, or a bad controller (which the capacitor plugs in to). I guess you can't necessarily tell which of the two parts is defective, so I chose to order/replace both of them. I ordered the correct parts from partselect.com, and they alerted me that Frigidaire has a new replacement part for the capacitor. When the parts arrived (quickly, ftw!), I unplugged the freezer and snipped the two wires leading to the controller. Next I unplugged the controller from the compressor housing. I spliced the replacement controller's wires into the freezer's wires (using my own wire nuts...as none were included with my order :( ). I snapped the new controller onto the compressor mounting, and then plugged the capacitor in. I plugged the freezer back in, and it was time for the moment of truth. The interior light of the freezer came on, and I could hear the compressor 'humming'. I could hear it humming before the repair, so the big test was to see if it got cold. I was nervous because the freezer DIDN'T make the 'whoooshing' noise right away, but after just an hour, the 'test' mug of water was already turning into ice. It was fixed!!!! If you have these symptoms, you CAN do this!!! Unplug the freezer. Cut two wires. Unplug the controller. Splice two wires. Plug in the new controller. Snap in the new capacitor. DONE!!!

Sam from Cooper City, AL
Freezer & Frig Were Not Cold
First I removed the rear cover, located at the bottom of the refrigerator. Then I cleaned out the dirt & dust on and around the compressor. The relay has a cover, that is secured with a spring loaded clip. To release the clip, push in with your fingers, while disengaging the end clip with a screwdriver. Once one side is off the other lifts off. Remove cove exposing the relay. There is one wire terminated, with a spade clip, remove it. With a strait blade screwdriver, pry the relay off the 2 post it slides on to. (Don't be surprised if it breaks into pieces, as they are sometimes brittle. ) Slide the new relay onto the 2 posts, replace the wire onto the right terminal, and replace the relay cover & clip. Replace the rear cover. Plug in and test.

Our Refrigerator and freezer stopped working
I had read on a fix it site that the start device for the compressor on this particular model was known to fail after 3-5 years. When we received the part it looked like something that just plugged into the compressor. My husband unscrewed the panel in the back of the fridge and saw the part on the compressor. He first removed the three wires that it was connected to, and the wires were inside a plug so all he had to do was remove the plug from the start device. He then removed the old start device from the compressor. Plugged in the wire plug into the new start device, and pushed in the new start device into the compressor. There was also another black part plugged into the old start device that he plugged inot the new start device that connected to the compressor. Our freezer and refrigerator starting working. Within a couple of hours our freezer had made ice.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

MARK from LIBERTY LAKE, WA
Rear of upper shelf would freeze, while the rest of the freezer was dripping wet
We opened our freezer last week only to find the bottom 2/3 was barely cold, while only the rear of the upper shelf was cold. In fact, it was covered in frost, despite being a frost-free model. Our frozen veggies were slushy, not rock hard, and our frozen juices were all liquid. We defrosted the freezer, plugged it back in, but immediately noticed that we didn't hear the 'whhoooooosh' that you typically hear when you close the freezer door. After 30 minutes, the rear upper shelf was frosty again, but the rest was still at room temp. We figured the freezer was a goner, so we started looking at new freezers. I headed online to see if I could fix it, and I eventually found this site. I had learned online that these symptoms can be caused by either a bad capacitor, or a bad controller (which the capacitor plugs in to). I guess you can't necessarily tell which of the two parts is defective, so I chose to order/replace both of them. I ordered the correct parts from partselect.com, and they alerted me that Frigidaire has a new replacement part for the capacitor. When the parts arrived (quickly, ftw!), I unplugged the freezer and snipped the two wires leading to the controller. Next I unplugged the controller from the compressor housing. I spliced the replacement controller's wires into the freezer's wires (using my own wire nuts...as none were included with my order :( ). I snapped the new controller onto the compressor mounting, and then plugged the capacitor in. I plugged the freezer back in, and it was time for the moment of truth. The interior light of the freezer came on, and I could hear the compressor 'humming'. I could hear it humming before the repair, so the big test was to see if it got cold. I was nervous because the freezer DIDN'T make the 'whoooshing' noise right away, but after just an hour, the 'test' mug of water was already turning into ice. It was fixed!!!! If you have these symptoms, you CAN do this!!! Unplug the freezer. Cut two wires. Unplug the controller. Splice two wires. Plug in the new controller. Snap in the new capacitor. DONE!!!

Soldered Heat exchanger line to drier and 1/4” copper line to compressor. Wrapped with new insulation wrap. Pulled a vacuum on system and then charged with 4.4 ounces of 134a freon.

Sam from Cooper City, AL
Freezer & Frig Were Not Cold
First I removed the rear cover, located at the bottom of the refrigerator. Then I cleaned out the dirt & dust on and around the compressor. The relay has a cover, that is secured with a spring loaded clip. To release the clip, push in with your fingers, while disengaging the end clip with a screwdriver. Once one side is off the other lifts off. Remove cove exposing the relay. There is one wire terminated, with a spade clip, remove it. With a strait blade screwdriver, pry the relay off the 2 post it slides on to. (Don't be surprised if it breaks into pieces, as they are sometimes brittle. ) Slide the new relay onto the 2 posts, replace the wire onto the right terminal, and replace the relay cover & clip. Replace the rear cover. Plug in and test.

Anna from Lincoln, RI
Our Refrigerator and freezer stopped working
I had read on a fix it site that the start device for the compressor on this particular model was known to fail after 3-5 years. When we received the part it looked like something that just plugged into the compressor. My husband unscrewed the panel in the back of the fridge and saw the part on the compressor. He first removed the three wires that it was connected to, and the wires were inside a plug so all he had to do was remove the plug from the start device. He then removed the old start device from the compressor. Plugged in the wire plug into the new start device, and pushed in the new start device into the compressor. There was also another black part plugged into the old start device that he plugged inot the new start device that connected to the compressor. Our freezer and refrigerator starting working. Within a couple of hours our freezer had made ice.

Refrigerator Door Mullion Spring
★★★★★
★★★★★
69 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163672
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01345B
The French door divider spring fits most Samsung French door style refrigerators. The spring applies tension between components in the refrigerator, which engages and retracts the door flap. This will allow the door to close properly. If the spring is broken, damaged, or faulty the door flap will swing open and block the door from closing, and you should look to replace the part straight away to prevent further damage to the door. The spring is a genuine OEM part, is made of metal, and measures at 1 1/2"" long. This part is also known as a refrigerator door mullion spring.

Left side French Door flap on Samsung refrigerator didn't retract when closing.
OMG seriously! I stopped into my go-to appliance repair shop to ask about what might be needed to repair the problem with my refrigerator door. They said you will need to replace the Mullion Flap piece. Cost would be $250-300 with part, labor and service. I went on line to see if I could handle the repair process myself. I found a How to - U Tube video and turns out I only needed to replace a little spring and pin not the whole Mullion Flap. Went to Parts select, ordered the spring and pin and did the repair myself in about 5 minutes. Shipping was $7 so I ended up paying $13 total.

This pin acts as a sleeve for the French door spring in a refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part that is sold individually and works with the spring within the door mullion to seal the door shut. If you need to replace the sleeve, check whether the spring in the door is still intact as well. You will only need to replace one spring sleeve pin per door, as there is only one sleeve on the upper part of the spring. To remove the spring and replace the mullion, do so with a set of needle-nose pliers and lift the lower side of the spring to easily pull it out, then you can replace the sleeve.?

flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

Refrigerator Door Mullion Spring
★★★★★
★★★★★
69 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163672
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01345B
The French door divider spring fits most Samsung French door style refrigerators. The spring applies tension between components in the refrigerator, which engages and retracts the door flap. This will allow the door to close properly. If the spring is broken, damaged, or faulty the door flap will swing open and block the door from closing, and you should look to replace the part straight away to prevent further damage to the door. The spring is a genuine OEM part, is made of metal, and measures at 1 1/2"" long. This part is also known as a refrigerator door mullion spring.

Installation Instructions
HOLLIE from FORT WAYNE, IN
Left side French Door flap on Samsung refrigerator didn't retract when closing.
OMG seriously! I stopped into my go-to appliance repair shop to ask about what might be needed to repair the problem with my refrigerator door. They said you will need to replace the Mullion Flap piece. Cost would be $250-300 with part, labor and service. I went on line to see if I could handle the repair process myself. I found a How to - U Tube video and turns out I only needed to replace a little spring and pin not the whole Mullion Flap. Went to Parts select, ordered the spring and pin and did the repair myself in about 5 minutes. Shipping was $7 so I ended up paying $13 total.

Refrigerator Spring PIN - French
★★★★★
★★★★★
18 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163673
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01346A
This pin acts as a sleeve for the French door spring in a refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part that is sold individually and works with the spring within the door mullion to seal the door shut. If you need to replace the sleeve, check whether the spring in the door is still intact as well. You will only need to replace one spring sleeve pin per door, as there is only one sleeve on the upper part of the spring. To remove the spring and replace the mullion, do so with a set of needle-nose pliers and lift the lower side of the spring to easily pull it out, then you can replace the sleeve.?

Bill from Cleveland Heights, OH
flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

Dave from Lake Ronkonkoma, NY
Gaskets magnet was tearing out. Door Handle was Broken off, Kickplate was missing.
The gasket came off as one piece, so all that was needed was to push the new one on. The Door Handle was broken off when we attempted to move it, the repair was removing 3 screws and replacing them with the new Handle and screws. The Kickplate just clipped into place.

Everything was looking great untill 2 of the three parts went missing durning shipment. PartSelect refunded the money and sent out new parts. Chalk one up for FedEx. They said they deleiverd the packages(s) When in fact I got shipment 1 of 2. 2 Never showed up.

The repair went great and if it wasnt for FedEx, the shiping went great.

Gaskets magnet was tearing out. Door Handle was Broken off, Kickplate was missing.
The gasket came off as one piece, so all that was needed was to push the new one on. The Door Handle was broken off when we attempted to move it, the repair was removing 3 screws and replacing them with the new Handle and screws. The Kickplate just clipped into place.

Everything was looking great untill 2 of the three parts went missing durning shipment. PartSelect refunded the money and sent out new parts. Chalk one up for FedEx. They said they deleiverd the packages(s) When in fact I got shipment 1 of 2. 2 Never showed up.

The repair went great and if it wasnt for FedEx, the shiping went great.

PartSelect Number PS11722923
Manufacturer Part Number W10803964
This is a kickplate, but you may also know it as a grate or a grille. It is a part for your refrigerator. The purpose of the kickplate is to allow air to circulate by flowing through the grates and into the machine compartment. This circulation of air is necessary because it will then cool the condenser. Black in color.

Installation Instructions
Janet from SOUTH ST PAUL, MN
Clips on old toe kick plate were broken on one side. Would not stay on
Took the new kick plate out of the box. Snapped it into position. I have had a repairman for this refrigerator before. I would rather repair an appliance than buy a new one. I'm very proud that I thought to get a replacement part myself instead of calling my friendly repairman again. Saved a few dollars.

PartSelect Number PS11742410
Manufacturer Part Number WP4356840
This metal freezer door key has a cross shape and is approximately 2 inches long. If your freezer door will not stay shut, you can use the key as a quick fix to keep it closed. If your key will not lock, or unlock the freezer door, check to see if it has been bent or damaged. If the key is damaged, you should look to replace it to avoid damaging the lock. The key should engage the locking mechanism with ease. If the lock sticks when you turn the key, penetrating fluid should be used to loosen the mechanism. These keys are sold separately, and should be stored somewhere safe and not next to the unit.
Installation Instructions
Jervonia from WINDSOR HILLS, CA
Change freezer door gasket
I wasn't able to do repair because we received the wrong parts. I have called no less than 5 times and got a hold of one person. I was told you'd be sending a return label by email. No return label has been sent and its 6 days later. You're delay is forcing us outside
of the 30 day return period. I hope you keep your word and give me my money back.

Refrigerator Water Dispenser Button
★★★★★

6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8748092
Manufacturer Part Number ABH74219603
This water dispenser button is a genuine OEM part designed for LG refrigerators. When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.

Plastic Ice maker button broke from pushing it too hard
Replaced the ice bin button by removing the ice bin, turning it upside down and dumping the ice, and replacing the pastic part that broke with the right size socket. It was very easy. Part was easy to find at PartSelect. Would have just left it broken if I could not find the part as a repair person would have charged $100 just to come to the house and I would have had to take off work. With PartSelect, it cost me $15 and I fixed it myself in under 10 minutes. Way to go PartSelect!!

Refrigerator Water Dispenser Button
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8748092
Manufacturer Part Number ABH74219603
This water dispenser button is a genuine OEM part designed for LG refrigerators. When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.

Installation Instructions
Ralph D from EOLIA, MO
Ice dispenser continued to dispense ice unless I turned it off all together
Removed the section of refrigerator that dispenses ice and water. Necessary to pry with object that does not scratch like plastic scraper. Then pull out and replace the switch Micro -- only has one Phillips screw holding switch. Replaced the dispenser and snapped on the New button assembly I broke and job was done. Works perfectly now..

Installation Instructions
CAL from IRVINE, CA
Plastic Ice maker button broke from pushing it too hard
Replaced the ice bin button by removing the ice bin, turning it upside down and dumping the ice, and replacing the pastic part that broke with the right size socket. It was very easy. Part was easy to find at PartSelect. Would have just left it broken if I could not find the part as a repair person would have charged $100 just to come to the house and I would have had to take off work. With PartSelect, it cost me $15 and I fixed it myself in under 10 minutes. Way to go PartSelect!!

Nate from MILWAUKEE, AL
Water tank cracked
So there's a plastic water tank in our fridge, its purpose is to chill water so it's nice and cold when you dispense it from the freezer door tap. Long story short, during out kitchen remodel I stored the fridge in our unheated Wisconsin garage. The leftover water in the tank froze, expanded and ruptured it. Got the replacement, super easy to fix. The tubing connections are shark bite, just press them together and they're water tight. Pretty simple plug and play operation but you do have to pull the fridge all the way from the wall and shut off the water supply.
I replaced the filter too, just incase the freezing water messed with it in some undetectable way.

Refrigerator Adjustable Leveling Foot - Black
PartSelect Number PS425733
Manufacturer Part Number 216396900
This part could be found underneath a fridge, dryer, or freezer. The original foot may be cracked, broken, or perhaps missing altogether. If you notice the appliance is uneven to the floor or wobbling, it may indicate that the levelling foot needs to be replaced. You will need pliers and a block of wood to perform this task. There will be one adjustable foot found in the package. Lift the dryer and place the wood to keep it propped up. You may need to use the pliers to remove the old foot. Screw the new foot into place using your hand. Once the new leveling foot is in place, lift the appliance and remove the block. Test the machine out to ensure it is now sitting level.

Refrigerator Foot Brake

PartSelect Number PS11748978
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10141622
Installation Instructions
Daniel from BOCA RATON, FL
Original bracket foot brake screw hole was stripped and foot brake would not extend
The repair seemed simple, I just needed to remove the old bracket -- 4 screws -- and slip the new one on.

The tricky bit is that the roller bracket holds the weight of the fridge. So in order to make sure that the fridge did not fall over, and to keep the installation point off the ground so that I could align the screw holes, I needed to shim up the side of the fridge that I was working on.

To tap in the shims, I used a hammer and a spare chunk of wood. I ultimately used 3 shims, and kept tapping until the roller wheel could roll freely. Then I knew that the fridge was high enough. After that, it was pretty easy to remove the 4 screws, align the new bracket, and replace the screws. After that, in order to get the shims out I could just extend the foot brake as it was designed, and that lifted the fridge enough for me to easily slide out the shims. After that I just had to level out the fridge by adjusting the two feet.

Installation Instructions
Phil from Fairfax, VA
Water was leaking.
This unit was unique that whole motor assembly was held in its place by two plastic clip. The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak. Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off. 4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place. Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface. Put spray arm back on. Finished.

After that, it was pretty easy to remove the 4 screws, align the new bracket, and replace the screws. After that, in order to get the shims out I could just extend the foot brake as it was designed, and that lifted the fridge enough for me to easily slide out the shims. After that I just had to level out the fridge by adjusting the two feet.

Refrigerator Leveling Leg
PartSelect Number PS557020
Manufacturer Part Number 8193716
Leveling leg Now includes two different sizes. Use the one for your model. If you need two legs you will need to purchase a QTY of two of this kit.
Installation Instructions
Phil from Fairfax, VA
Water was leaking.
This unit was unique that whole motor assembly was held in its place by two plastic clip. The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak. Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off. 4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place. Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface. Put spray arm back on. Finished.

Refrigerator Adjustable Leveling Foot - Black
PartSelect Number PS425733
Manufacturer Part Number 216396900
This part could be found underneath a fridge, dryer, or freezer. The original foot may be cracked, broken, or perhaps missing altogether. If you notice the appliance is uneven to the floor or wobbling, it may indicate that the levelling foot needs to be replaced. You will need pliers and a block of wood to perform this task. There will be one adjustable foot found in the package. Lift the dryer and place the wood to keep it propped up. You may need to use the pliers to remove the old foot. Screw the new foot into place using your hand. Once the new leveling foot is in place, lift the appliance and remove the block. Test the machine out to ensure it is now sitting level.

Installation Instructions
Daniel from BOCA RATON, FL
Original bracket foot brake screw hole was stripped and foot brake would not extend
The repair seemed simple, I just needed to remove the old bracket -- 4 screws -- and slip the new one on.

The tricky bit is that the roller bracket holds the weight of the fridge. So in order to make sure that the fridge did not fall over, and to keep the installation point off the ground so that I could align the screw holes, I needed to shim up the side of the fridge that I was working on.

To tap in the shims, I used a hammer and a spare chunk of wood. I ultimately used 3 shims, and kept tapping until the roller wheel could roll freely. Then I knew that the fridge was high enough.

Refrigerator Evaporator Drip Tray

PartSelect Number PS11756735
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10614158
This is the replacement evaporator drip tray for your refrigerator. It is made of white plastic and is approximately 19 inches by 9 inches. The evaporator drip tray sits below the evaporator to collect dripping water. If the drip tray is damaged, you may notice that your refrigerator is leaking. Because it is made of plastic, the drip tray can eventually develop a crack. You will need to pull out the refrigerator from the wall, and take off the bottom panel on the back of your refrigerator in order to access the drip tray for replacement. This is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Jerrel from REDDING, CA
Cracked Evaporation tray was leaking water on kitchen floor
I emptied refrigerator contents and tilted the refrigerator to the right so as to access the metal panel upon which the evaporation tray was resting. The metal panel is on the left side underneath the refrigerator and the evaporation tray is resting on the panel. I removed 4 screws that were holding the metal panel, pressed down on the panel, slid out the old, cracked plastic evaporation tray, inserted the new plastic evaporation tray, raised the metal panel to its original position, replaced the 4 screws, being careful not to pinched the water line that feeds the ice-maker. VOILA! Un-tilt the frig and re-stock it. It took a day for the temperature to stabilize, due to tilting, I think. New tray $45.

This is the replacement evaporator drip pan, also known as the drain trough, for your refrigerator. You will find the drip pan in the fresh food section of the refrigerator. It collects any water that may drip off the evaporator. If your drip pan is rusted, or is leaking into the refrigerator, you may need to replace it. Before you install the new drip pan, you will want to thoroughly clean the areas around the evaporator to ensure there is no more remaining rust or debris. This part is sold individually and is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Gregory from El Dorado, AR
Trough Drain pan was rusted
First I removed the shelving from the refrigerator side I then removed the cover to the refrigerator condenser which consisted of a plastic cover and a styrofoam inner chamber cover. The Condenser is held in place with two stainless phillips head screws. I removed the screws and gently pulled the condenser forward so that the Drain pan could be easily removed. The drain pan is made out of thin sheet metal with a galvanized coating that will not hold up it will start rusting in a short time. I inspected the drain pan cleaned it up with a little Muretic acid and it had too many rust holes so I couldn't repair it. I ordered a new Drain pan on Part Select and when it came in I washed it and dried it completely then I sprayed it with Cold Galvanizing compound with zinc particles. You can get this from Home Depot on the spray paint isle. Hopefully the spray Galvanizing will keep it from rusting in the future and leaking inside the refrigerator. The Trough Drain Pan should have been made of Stainless sheet metal or plastic I don't really know why they used the galvanized coated pan. Everything went back together in reverse with no problems. Hopefully this drain pan will last longer than the first drain pan because it was only 4 years old. I remember when the older refrigerators would run for decades.

Dave from WALNUT CREEK, CA
Lights stayed on even with doors closed
Access to the main PCB is at the back of the fridge. Once the cover plate is off, notes were made of the cable connections though not truly necessary as the cable connectors are almost all at different sizes. Sharp nose pliers made removal of the connectors way easier. The new board fixed the problem as advertised.

Refrigerator Damper
PartSelect Number PS11751310
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10257451
Installation Instructions
John from DALLAS, NC
Fridge too cold. Food freezing. Water line frozen. Running too long.
Removed 2 screws holding cover (one on left; one behind air filter on rear wall), removed cover, removed styrofoam duct, unplugged and removed old damper. The styrofoam duct broke slightly during the removal process. This was easily fixed with some 3M spray adhesive. While the adhesive dried, I packed the air passage between the fridge & freezer with paper towels to help the fridge cycle a bit (this worked surprisingly well). After finally installing the new damper and repaired styrofoam duct, the fridge went right back to freezing the food again (I soon realized this was caused by a VERY SMALL air leak where the new damper mates with the flange located on the freezer). After making a gasket with some self adhesive1/8"" thick weatherstripping and applying it to the damper, things are back to normal operation.

It couldn’t have been easier.We had searched everywhere for this replacement shield and parts select was the the only ones that had it. Very good service and fast delivery,

Fiber Acoustic.
Installation Instructions
Julie from San Diego, CA
Insulation was disintegrating.
On the back of the refrigerator, I unscrewed and removed the lower-right panel. As I peeled the insulation off the panel, the insulation would disintegrate, so I used a vacuum-cleaner hose to remove most of the insulation. I removed the remaining adhesive with my fingers. I peeled the backing off the new insulation, and stuck it to the panel.

I had ordered two pieces of insulation, hoping to also replace the insulation behind the compressor, but removing the compressor was complicated and risky, so I returned the second piece of insulation.

Refrigerator 2 Piece Broiler Pan
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS971245
Manufacturer Part Number 4396923
This is cookware designed for use in your range or oven. It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.

Refrigerator 2 Piece Broiler Pan
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS971245
Manufacturer Part Number 4396923
This is cookware designed for use in your range or oven. It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.

Briant from Byron, MN
There was no problem
I simply had to hook up the power cord to the dishwasher so i could plug it into the outlet rather than direct wire the appliance. Everything went very smoothly. Everything needed for installation other than tools was provided. Easy to follow instructions if you know a little about electrical wiring.

PartSelect Number PS759476
Manufacturer Part Number WR23X10300
This heavy-duty cord has a three-pronged plug (2 electrical, 1 grounding). The power cord supplies power to your refrigerator, allowing it to keep the contents inside cool. There could be an issue with your cord if you notice that the refrigerator will not turn on, or intermittently turns on and off. Check the cord for fraying, or other visible damage. If the power cord shows any signs of damage, replace the cord immediately as it could become an electrical or fire hazard. Before you begin this repair, ensure that the power is disconnected from the unit, and that all food that could ruin is stored away while the power is off.

Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Blade
PartSelect Number PS4138288
Manufacturer Part Number DA31-00016A
This evaporator fan blade is for refrigerators. Evaporator fan blade circulates air through the evaporator fins and interior compartment of the refrigerator to improve the cooling efficiency.
Installation Instructions
Ductri from RESEDA, CA
Refrigeration side was not cold enough.
Replaced the Broken Cover Motor and the Fan Blade. Fan motor was test with 12VDC power supply, or by replugging fan connector and holding down the door closing switch.

After a few days, the fan made loud noise. Due to defrog heater was open when it was test with ohmmeter. Ice deposited around the fan.

I had to buy a whole ASSY EVAP-REF part # DA96-00395C, and seperated the evaperator, and replaced the heater and sensor.
Spray bottle was used spray hot water to de-iced the evaperator. And salt accelerated the ice melting process.

Note: spray water to clean salt before installing new parts

Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Blade
PartSelect Number PS4138288
Manufacturer Part Number DA31-00016A
This evaporator fan blade is for refrigerators. Evaporator fan blade circulates air through the evaporator fins and interior compartment of the refrigerator to improve the cooling efficiency.
Installation Instructions
Ductri from RESEDA, CA
Refrigeration side was not cold enough.
Replaced the Broken Cover Motor and the Fan Blade. Fan motor was test with 12VDC power supply, or by replugging fan connector and holding down the door closing switch.

After a few days, the fan made loud noise. Due to defrog heater was open when it was test with ohmmeter. Ice deposited around the fan.

I had to buy a whole ASSY EVAP-REF part # DA96-00395C, and seperated the evaperator, and replaced the heater and sensor.
Spray bottle was used spray hot water to de-iced the evaperator. And salt accelerated the ice melting process.

Note: spray water to clean salt before installing new parts

Installation Instructions
William from WILDWOOD CRST, NJ
Upper coupling broken on Ice Bucket Assembly and inner segment and shroud broken on Chute Assembly.
I was disappointed you have to purchase the entire Ice Bucket Assembly in order to get the upper coupling. I also ordered the two seals and washer, only to find they are included in the Chute Assembly. The Chute was a little difficult to remove and reinstall. Other than that the Ice Bucket slides right in and the Chute Assembly requires 2 Phillips screws and 2 hex screws to be removed and reinstalled.

Installation Instructions
James from Valrico, FL
Ice wouldn't dispense from the door.
Simple. Removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover with two screws on the bottom, then removed the ice door mechanism and replaced the small sealing door and door motor. Reassembled and tested . Works perfect. Replacing the door was neccessary as the foam gasket was worn and probably leaking air even though the motor was the real problem. I would absolutely recommend changing the door anytime you have to replace any other part. PartSelect is amazing...ordered the parts on Friday, had them in-hand on Sunday...all for less than $3.00 shipping. Will do business with again.

After checking the capacitor and 3 in 1 starter run relay for continuity and both measuring , I was able to remove the old parts and install the new parts for the refrigerator after unplugging the unit. I also checked the new parts prior to installing. I also went on Parts Select and watched some very helpful videos. Thanks a lot for your help desk for going above and beyond to ensure that I ordered the correct part! ????

ELAINA from QUEENS VILLAGE, NY
Fridgerator shorted out. Smoke coming from back.
There was an accidental spill which seeped through the water-hose feed hole in the bottom of the fridge. The liquid had dripped down onto the Starter and Run Capacitor and shorted them out. I called an applicance repair shop to possibly get it fixed. They estimated around $500 with the service call, parts and labor. Not a chance was they getting that from me. So I unhooked the retaining wired and removed the burnt parts. I then looked up the part numbers and ordered the 2 parts I needed from Parts Select for $50 bucks including shipping. In just two days my order arrived. I installed the 2 parts the same way and as easily as I took them out. Now my fridge is running good as new. When my HUSBAND returned home from work he was stunned to see that I had done the repair without his help. He laughed and said, ""Yep. You da' woman!""

Installation Instructions
Bruce from TEMPLE HILLS, MD
Warm fridge and freezer
After checking the capacitor and 3 in 1 starter run relay for continuity and both measuring , I was able to remove the old parts and install the new parts for the refrigerator after unplugging the unit. I also checked the new parts prior to installing. I also went on Parts Select and watched some very helpful videos. Thanks a lot for your help desk for going above and beyond to ensure that I ordered the correct part! ????

Installation Instructions
ELAINA from QUEENS VILLAGE, NY
Fridgerator shorted out. Smoke coming from back.
There was an accidental spill which seeped through the water-hose feed hole in the bottom of the fridge. The liquid had dripped down onto the Starter and Run Capacitor and shorted them out. I called an applicance repair shop to possibly get it fixed. They estimated around $500 with the service call, parts and labor. Not a chance was they getting that from me. So I unhooked the retaining wired and removed the burnt parts. I then looked up the part numbers and ordered the 2 parts I needed from Parts Select for $50 bucks including shipping. In just two days my order arrived. I installed the 2 parts the same way and as easily as I took them out. Now my fridge is running good as new. When my HUSBAND returned home from work he was stunned to see that I had done the repair without his help. He laughed and said, ""Yep. You da' woman!""

Installation Instructions
john from EL PORTAL, FL
replace outer cover & handle
It is a very difficult project due to the fact I am still waiting for the 3rd part needed to complete a 10 minute panel replacement. If you are a contractor do NOT give your client a completion date based upon this website information. Showing parts available, until you place your order and pay your money. You then get an email from Part Select advising you one of the parts really isn't available. You call about a week later and are told the part will be in there warehouse by the 18. You call the 19th and are told the part will be in by the 23rd. God only knows if I'll ever get the part needed (a white door handle). Buyer be ware.

Ed from POMPANO BEACH, FL
Replaced black front w/ stainless steel
The only appliance that wasn't SS was my $900 dishwasher that was tiled-in when my kitchen floors were done...I can only replace it by removing the granite counter. I ordered the SS front and handle to update the look of the 4 year old DW and it was a really good idea. * screws later and it was done. The 'repair' took 15-20 minutes and the results are amazing. BTW...the parts took less than 2 business days to arrive...

Installation Instructions
Bob from St. Louis, MO
Ice Dispenser not working properly
The ice dispenser would not dispense cubes. It only dispensed crushed ice. Also the plastic auger was partially broken and it took forever for ice to be dispensed. The auger was easy to figure out that it was broken. The dispenser issue took some time. I removed the ice bin and removed the panel behind it. There was a solenoid that burnt and melted and this did not allow the dispenser door to be controlled. I ordered the parts on a Thursday and they arrived on a Friday. Pretty simple to fix once I knew what the problem was. I could have gotten the parts cheaper from Searsparts.com but their description of parts and their pictures did not match and I wanted to make sure I got the right parts the first time. To be on the safe side I ordered a couple of pins and used one of them. The pin was a little hard to remove from the existing assemble so I put it in a vice and used a small pick and hammered out the old pin.

This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well.

This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges.

Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

This water filter is a genuine replacement for bottom-freezer refrigerators that accept a Filter 2. it is certified to remove up to 24 different contaminants which include pharmaceuticals, waterborne parasites, lead, and pesticides. The filter should be replaced every six months, or when 200 gallons of water have passed through, to ensure optimum contaminant reduction. The filter is found in the top right corner of your fridge, and replacing it is easy. Simply pop out the old one (keep a bucket underneath to catch any water) and slide in the new one. You will hear a click once it has locked into place. You should run water through the filter for a couple minutes prior to use. This filter measures approximately two inches wide, two inches deep, and 7.5 inches long.

PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

James from NEW LONDON, NH
Ice maker has stopped making ice and made a loud banging sound
I turned the water and electricity off for the refrigerator.
(not sure if this is necessary but is safer)
Remove the ice bucket.
Cover the Ice auger with a hand towel to catch any screws which my get dropped.
Remove four Philips screws holding plastic cover to inside of the door. there are no clip/snaps to worry about but on/off switch needs to be un plugged. Remove cover.
Remove two nut head screws holding old ice maker.
Remove wiring harness from ice maker and lift ice maker up and out. There are two tabs on the door.
Unplug the wiring harness from the ice maker..

Installation: Press the wiring harness into clips on the new ice maker. Install ice maker onto door insuring it is over the tabs on door and the holes for nut screws line up. Plugging the wiring harness in and install two screws.

Plug on/off wiring onto switch and press plastic cover onto inside of door. Take care that it fits inside of rubber door seal. Install four philips screws.

Admiral Refrigerator Meat Drawer Shelf

PartSelect Number PS11731608
Manufacturer Part Number W10861519
This is a meat drawer shelf frame for some models of refrigerator. This white plastic frame measures approximately 12-inches wide and 16 inches long, and is used to allow the meat drawer to easily slide in and out of the fridge. If your meat drawer is currently sagging and this frame is damaged and not supporting it enough, it needs to be replaced. Replacing this frame requires you to remove the meat drawer and the glass shelf above it, so you can flip it over and slide out the old frame, and slide in the new. This frame is supplied by the original equipment manufacturer and is sold individually, so it does not include any other parts for the meat drawer or shelf above it.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did.

This OEM, clear convertible meat drawer can be used to store meats or vegetables and is designed for the lower portion of your refrigerator, generally.

Inspect it for visible damage like cracking or warping, which should be obvious. This part measures approximately 16 7/16 inches wide x 14 5/16 inches deep x 7 5/8 inches high and is a genuine OEM replacement part. It is sold individually.

This manufacturer-approved Refrigerator Pantry End Cap Kit, also known as the Refrigerator Drawer Support, is a kit containing all parts of the Pantry End Cap. It snaps into place on the appliance’s pantry drawer to help contain the items inside and to keep your refrigerator door from sliding all the way out. It is rated as ""medium"" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Installation Instructions
Carl from Hampton, NH
This Ice maker tray flexes to release the cubes, and the rectangular slot in the tray splits apart not allowing the tray to flex and release the cubes. - its a weak design.
I reinforced the ice cube tray rectangular slot with a thin .080"" plastic disc cut to fit the ice tray - you need to remove the cube tray from the round holder, add the reinforcement around the plastic slot then reinstall. Also, I polished the cube trays with Carnuba wax (food safe) to better release the ice.

All is well now, and I have 2 spare ice trays modified and ready to install.

This is a tray design issue - Bosch should increase thickness of the molded plastic fitment and tray where the ice tray engages the motor.

Caloric Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Caloric Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Caloric Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Caloric Refrigerator Defrost Timer
★★★★★
★★★★★
40 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11723171
Manufacturer Part Number W10822278
The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

★★★★★
★★★★★
50 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS395284
Manufacturer Part Number 833697

Arau from Haverhill, MA
The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Caloric Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
31 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746522
Manufacturer Part Number W10613606
This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

Gilbert from Clinton, MO
The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Caloric Refrigerator Door Light Switch
★★★★★
★★★★★
15 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11738900
Manufacturer Part Number WP2149705
The purpose of the light switch in your refrigerator is to automatically turn on the light when the door is opened. If the light does not come on automatically when you open the door, the contacts inside the light switch may be burned out, meaning it is time to replace the switch. This package contains both the new light switch and a small plastic spacer. To complete this repair, you will need to remove the control panel section of your refrigerator. The only tools you will require for this repair are a 1/4-inch nut driver and maybe a small flat blade screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect the power source from the refrigerator before completing this repair.

Broken light switch
Took all the screws out of the plastic shroud that encloses the switch .There only four that I needed to remove, were the two in front where the switches that go,they go in horizontally and two in the back with large washers on them that hold the back to the top of the box that go in vertically.The switch was a snap ( make that two snaps ) the wiring is almost self explanatory. then it gos back to the way you took it off. OH! and don't forget to turn the light bulb all the way back in to the socket , so the light will work after you take the time to install it yourself.I had the water supply line from under the box to the water dispenser in the door and the total bill on that was one hundred thirty seven and a hand full of change.Don't be afraid to do it yourself the savings is enough on one one item to make several months payments on a new one Randy the ""Handy Man'

Caloric Refrigerator Bimetal Defrost Thermostat
★★★★★
★★★★★
17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742474
Manufacturer Part Number WP4387503
This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

Caloric Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Caloric Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Caloric Refrigerator Defrost Timer
★★★★★
★★★★★
40 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11723171
Manufacturer Part Number W10822278
The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions

Caloric Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Caloric Refrigerator Defrost Timer
★★★★★
★★★★★
40 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11723171
Manufacturer Part Number W10822278
The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

Arau from Haverhill, MA
The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Caloric Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
31 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746522
Manufacturer Part Number W10613606
This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

Gilbert from Clinton, MO
The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Caloric Refrigerator Door Light Switch
★★★★★
★★★★★
15 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11738900
Manufacturer Part Number WP2149705
The purpose of the light switch in your refrigerator is to automatically turn on the light when the door is opened. If the light does not come on automatically when you open the door, the contacts inside the light switch may be burned out, meaning it is time to replace the switch. This package contains both the new light switch and a small plastic spacer. To complete this repair, you will need to remove the control panel section of your refrigerator. The only tools you will require for this repair are a 1/4-inch nut driver and maybe a small flat blade screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect the power source from the refrigerator before completing this repair.

Broken light switch
Took all the screws out of the plastic shroud that encloses the switch .There only four that I needed to remove, were the two in front where the switches that go,they go in horizontally and two in the back with large washers on them that hold the back to the top of the box that go in vertically.The switch was a snap ( make that two snaps ) the wiring is almost self explanatory. then it gos back to the way you took it off. OH! and don't forget to turn the light bulb all the way back in to the socket , so the light will work after you take the time to install it yourself.I had the water supply line from under the box to the water dispenser in the door and the total bill on that was one hundred thirty seven and a hand full of change.Don't be afraid to do it yourself the savings is enough on one one item to make several months payments on a new one Randy the ""Handy Man'

This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well.

This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.

Dacor Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Chauncey from Menan, ID
Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

Dacor Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.
Fixes these symptoms

Ice maker dispenses too little ice

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Door gasket wasnt sealing anymore and had some minor cracks
First, I removed the old door gasket by pulling it out of the channel it was mounted in, noting the orientation of the gasket. Then, it was a simple matter of lining the new gasket up with the channel and pressing it into the groove. Very easy repair, and the door seals great!

Chauncey from Menan, ID
Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage.

It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Electrolux Refrigerator Upper or Lower Mullion Hinge Pin

PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

PartSelect Number PS7784018
Manufacturer Part Number 242252702
The function of the Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve (Triple Solenoid Water-Valve, Water Valve, Water Inlet Valve, Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) is to release water from the supply line when activated, and send it through to your water dispenser or ice maker in your refrigerator. The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker. To install the new water valve it was just a matter of reversing steps.

PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches.

Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker. To install the new water valve it was just a matter of reversing steps.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Used pliers to remove the residual broken stud that was still attached to the wall of the refrigerator, and then just pushed the new part in place. The longest time was spent in removing the food and crisper drawers.

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

DIY Frigidaire Refrigerator Repair

Most Frigidaire refrigerator issues are simple to troubleshoot and fix. We are here to help walk you through the process of identifying the problems and figuring out what parts you need to fix them. These solutions are easy DIY tasks that anyone can tackle. Your Frigidaire refrigerator will be up and running in no time.

Noisy Frigidaire Refrigerator – Have you noticed new or increasing buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises coming from your Frigidaire refrigerator? There is no need to worry, these are common noises with simple fixes. There are many moving parts in your Frigidaire fridge, such as the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor, and friction and wear over time might lead to loud noises. You will need to pay attention to where the noise is coming from, and what it sounds like. For example, a scraping sound is caused by one of the internal fans brushing up against something as it spins. If you hear rattling check that your fridge is level, and the drain pan is secure. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Frigidaire Refrigerator – Water leaking from a fridge is not uncommon, and it is nothing to panic over. As you start troubleshooting the problem you are going to want to figure out where the water is pooling and look for any indications of how the water got there, for instance, is there condensation dripping? Is there any ice build-up that could be melting? You are also going to want to inspect your door gaskets and seals. If the door is not completely sealed that will not only lead to condensation but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the ice maker.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Will Not Run – If you cannot hear your Frigidaire refrigerator running, that can be worrying as it might not be cooling properly. This does not always indicate there is a big problem, many parts contribute to the monitoring of the internal temperature and communication with the control board. If any of those parts are not working properly it could lead to the compressor not running. The most common issues are with the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. So, we recommend you start by checking those, and if you have ruled them out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Frigidaire Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your Frigidaire refrigerator is not making ice you are going to want to ensure there is enough water being supplied to the tray to make the ice. Before you start looking for issues with the water supply you should inspect the bail arm in the icemaker. When it is engaged it indicates the ice bin is full, so the maker does not need to produce more ice. If the bail arm is stuck in that position the icemaker will not make ice. If you’ve ruled that out you can then move on to inspecting the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter. Checking these parts is a simple process, and it will help you identify any water supply issues.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Too Warm – If your Frigidaire refrigerator is not cooling properly and you have noticed it is too warm, it does not automatically indicate there is an issue with the control board. It could be something as simple as not having your Frigidaire fridge properly stocked. If that is not the issue, we recommend you ensure that air is circulating properly within the appliance. To do that you want to make sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If there is no problem there you should then look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

If the door is not completely sealed that will not only lead to condensation but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the ice maker.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Will Not Run – If you cannot hear your Frigidaire refrigerator running, that can be worrying as it might not be cooling properly. This does not always indicate there is a big problem, many parts contribute to the monitoring of the internal temperature and communication with the control board. If any of those parts are not working properly it could lead to the compressor not running. The most common issues are with the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. So, we recommend you start by checking those, and if you have ruled them out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Frigidaire Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your Frigidaire refrigerator is not making ice you are going to want to ensure there is enough water being supplied to the tray to make the ice. Before you start looking for issues with the water supply you should inspect the bail arm in the icemaker. When it is engaged it indicates the ice bin is full, so the maker does not need to produce more ice. If the bail arm is stuck in that position the icemaker will not make ice. If you’ve ruled that out you can then move on to inspecting the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter. Checking these parts is a simple process, and it will help you identify any water supply issues.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Too Warm – If your Frigidaire refrigerator is not cooling properly and you have noticed it is too warm, it does not automatically indicate there is an issue with the control board. It could be something as simple as not having your Frigidaire fridge properly stocked. If that is not the issue, we recommend you ensure that air is circulating properly within the appliance. To do that you want to make sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If there is no problem there you should then look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.","Frigidaire Refrigerator Parts

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

DIY Frigidaire Refrigerator Repair

Most Frigidaire refrigerator issues are simple to troubleshoot and fix. We are here to help walk you through the process of identifying the problems and figuring out what parts you need to fix them. These solutions are easy DIY tasks that anyone can tackle. Your Frigidaire refrigerator will be up and running in no time.

Noisy Frigidaire Refrigerator – Have you noticed new or increasing buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises coming from your Frigidaire refrigerator? There is no need to worry, these are common noises with simple fixes. There are many moving parts in your Frigidaire fridge, such as the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor, and friction and wear over time might lead to loud noises. You will need to pay attention to where the noise is coming from, and what it sounds like. For example, a scraping sound is caused by one of the internal fans brushing up against something as it spins. If you hear rattling check that your fridge is level, and the drain pan is secure. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Frigidaire Refrigerator – Water leaking from a fridge is not uncommon, and it is nothing to panic over. As you start troubleshooting the problem you are going to want to figure out where the water is pooling and look for any indications of how the water got there, for instance, is there condensation dripping? Is there any ice build-up that could be melting? You are also going to want to inspect your door gaskets and seals. If the door is not completely sealed that will not only lead to condensation but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the ice maker.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Will Not Run – If you cannot hear your Frigidaire refrigerator running, that can be worrying as it might not be cooling properly. This does not always indicate there is a big problem, many parts contribute to the monitoring of the internal temperature and communication with the control board. If any of those parts are not working properly it could lead to the compressor not running. The most common issues are with the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. So, we recommend you start by checking those, and if you have ruled them out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Frigidaire Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your Frigidaire refrigerator is not making ice you are going to want to ensure there is enough water being supplied to the tray to make the ice. Before you start looking for issues with the water supply you should inspect the bail arm in the icemaker. When it is engaged it indicates the ice bin is full, so the maker does not need to produce more ice. If the bail arm is stuck in that position the icemaker will not make ice. If you’ve ruled that out you can then move on to inspecting the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter. Checking these parts is a simple process, and it will help you identify any water supply issues.

Frigidaire Refrigerator Too Warm – If your Frigidaire refrigerator is not cooling properly and you have noticed it is too warm, it does not automatically indicate there is an issue with the control board. It could be something as simple as not having your Frigidaire fridge properly stocked. If that is not the issue, we recommend you ensure that air is circulating properly within the appliance. To do that you want to make sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If there is no problem there you should then look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

Unpacked, inspected, found two minor defects in the form of two tiny slivers along the seal edge which I cut with a small scissor, laid the seal down on the kitchen table, applied heat to the deformed areas and reshaped them with my fingers, heated the entire seal lightly, removed the old seal starting at the right hand upper corner using my fingers, installed the warm seal starting at the top corners by pushing it in its slot making sure the outer lip stayed out of the slot and worked my way around. I believe that the heat from the dryer made it pliable and easier to manage.

Elijah from Killeen, TX
I had several broken appilances broken with parts to be replaced.
I had ordered the parts from Part Select and came with in a week. I ahd a Whrilpool microwave that had a door panel and vent grille that needed to be replaced and that was rplced with ease took less that five minutes to do. My Maytag refridgerator had it kickplate grille replace along with the pivot block that took all of about two minutes. The longest job that took about 5 minutes was my Whirlpool glass oven door that needed to be replaced, but that was pretty ease to replace also with an extra hand from my son. I just didn't want to break another glass door or I would have done it myself plus I was teaching him how to do self reparts.

CYNTHIA from ALPHARETTA, GA
Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

Right door seal lower tab was torn.
Unpacked, inspected, found two minor defects in the form of two tiny slivers along the seal edge which I cut with a small scissor, laid the seal down on the kitchen table, applied heat to the deformed areas and reshaped them with my fingers, heated the entire seal lightly, removed the old seal starting at the right hand upper corner using my fingers, installed the warm seal starting at the top corners by pushing it in its slot making sure the outer lip stayed out of the slot and worked my way around. I believe that the heat from the dryer made it pliable and easier to manage.

Unpacked, inspected, found two minor defects in the form of two tiny slivers along the seal edge which I cut with a small scissor, laid the seal down on the kitchen table, applied heat to the deformed areas and reshaped them with my fingers, heated the entire seal lightly, removed the old seal starting at the right hand upper corner using my fingers, installed the warm seal starting at the top corners by pushing it in its slot making sure the outer lip stayed out of the slot and worked my way around. I believe that the heat from the dryer made it pliable and easier to manage.

Elijah from Killeen, TX
I had several broken appilances broken with parts to be replaced.
I had ordered the parts from Part Select and came with in a week. I ahd a Whrilpool microwave that had a door panel and vent grille that needed to be replaced and that was rplced with ease took less that five minutes to do. My Maytag refridgerator had it kickplate grille replace along with the pivot block that took all of about two minutes. The longest job that took about 5 minutes was my Whirlpool glass oven door that needed to be replaced, but that was pretty ease to replace also with an extra hand from my son. I just didn't want to break another glass door or I would have done it myself plus I was teaching him how to do self reparts.

CYNTHIA from ALPHARETTA, GA
Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

General Electric Refrigerator Water Filter
★★★★★

16 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16217433
Manufacturer Part Number XWFE
This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.

General Electric Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter
★★★★★
★★★★★
82 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746144
Manufacturer Part Number MWFP
This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Installation Instructions
Dave from HENDERSON, NV
Added parts to interior to improve capacity utilization
The 2 wire baskets FZ with their handles replaced one shelf in the freezer. Thus there was improved utilization of the capacity. When we originally filled the freezer, it was obvious that about 2 cubic feet were not used. Part numbers are WR21x10060 and WR12x10626. A similar situation is in the refrigerator side. We added the snack drawer and shelf pan assy. (replacing one glass shelf) and the shelf module FF to the door. Part numbers are WR32x26244, WR71x10685 and WR71x38318. I had to work with Parts Select Customer Service to identify the correct parts since they are not on the BOM for this model, but are on BOM's for similar capacity refrigerators. The service representatives were very helpful.

Plastic Auger blades broke in ice tray
I used a digital camera and photographed the assembled unit and the metal blades before I started the repair. Then, I removed the top screw on the clear shield. Flip over ice tray and removed two Phillips screws on bottom. Exterior plastic white cover comes off next. The cover sides have hard push-in white plastic tabs. Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight. Failing to do this will prevent cubed ice from dispensing.
It is not that hard to do the repair it just takes some patience and paying attention to details.

PartSelect Number PS12741350
Manufacturer Part Number WR60X31522
This 115-volt 60Hz evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer and circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated. If the motor has failed, the freezer/refrigerator will become too warm because the fan motor is not circulating the cool air from the freezer into the refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power to the appliance before starting your repair.

Then, I removed the two srews that hold the front part of the fan bracket behind the baffle and the back panel came out easily. Two more screws and one quick connect plug attached to the fan and I was done with removal.

Simple DIY General Electric Refrigerator Fixes

If your GE fridge is not functioning properly, it is a time-sensitive problem. We know you need to get your fridge back up and running as soon as possible to prevent food spoilage. There is no need to panic, most of the common issues you run into with GE refrigerators are easy to troubleshoot and fix. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts fix them.

Noisy GE Refrigerator – It is common to hear noises coming from your GE fridge. There is no need to worry; these issues are simple to identify and fix. It can be as simple as figuring out which area of the refrigerator the noise is coming from or what it sounds like. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. Most often, sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor. Over time the friction and wear and tear can lead to new noises coming from your appliance. For example, if you hear a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans contacting something as it spins. If you hear rattling, make sure the fridge is level, and check that the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking GE Refrigerator – Water leaking from your GE fridge is not a cause for panic, leaks from refrigerators are not uncommon and are often simple to fix. The first thing you want to do is identify where the water is pooling, that is a helpful clue as you begin troubleshooting. Then you will want to inspect the door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and icemaker. These parts are the most common culprits when it comes to GE refrigerator leaks.

GE Refrigerator Will Not Run – If the compressor in your GE refrigerator is not running, the appliance will not be able to cool. There are several parts that work together to monitor temperature, and tell the compressor when to run. If any one of those parts is not functioning, the compressor will not run. You should start by checking the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. If you have ruled those parts out, the issue may be with the compressor itself.

GE Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your GE fridge is not making ice, it often indicates there is a water supply issue. Before you start inspecting the water supply and pulling things out of your fridge, we recommend taking a quick look at the bail arm in the icemaker. If the bail arm is stuck, your icemaker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. Once that is ruled out, you will want to take a closer look at the water line, water inlet valve, or the water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is enough water flowing to the icemaker.

GE Refrigerator Too Warm – When your fridge is not cooling properly, it could be as simple as an air circulation problem; it is not always a control board problem. If your GE fridge is properly stocked, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you find no issues there, you should then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Added parts to interior to improve capacity utilization
The 2 wire baskets FZ with their handles replaced one shelf in the freezer. Thus there was improved utilization of the capacity. When we originally filled the freezer, it was obvious that about 2 cubic feet were not used. Part numbers are WR21x10060 and WR12x10626. A similar situation is in the refrigerator side. We added the snack drawer and shelf pan assy. (replacing one glass shelf) and the shelf module FF to the door. Part numbers are WR32x26244, WR71x10685 and WR71x38318. I had to work with Parts Select Customer Service to identify the correct parts since they are not on the BOM for this model, but are on BOM's for similar capacity refrigerators. The service representatives were very helpful.

Plastic Auger blades broke in ice tray
I used a digital camera and photographed the assembled unit and the metal blades before I started the repair. Then, I removed the top screw on the clear shield. Flip over ice tray and removed two Phillips screws on bottom. Exterior plastic white cover comes off next. The cover sides have hard push-in white plastic tabs. Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight. Failing to do this will prevent cubed ice from dispensing.
It is not that hard to do the repair it just takes some patience and paying attention to details.

Simple DIY General Electric Refrigerator Fixes

If your GE fridge is not functioning properly, it is a time-sensitive problem. We know you need to get your fridge back up and running as soon as possible to prevent food spoilage. There is no need to panic, most of the common issues you run into with GE refrigerators are easy to troubleshoot and fix. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts fix them.

Noisy GE Refrigerator – It is common to hear noises coming from your GE fridge. There is no need to worry; these issues are simple to identify and fix. It can be as simple as figuring out which area of the refrigerator the noise is coming from or what it sounds like. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. Most often, sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor. Over time the friction and wear and tear can lead to new noises coming from your appliance. For example, if you hear a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans contacting something as it spins. If you hear rattling, make sure the fridge is level, and check that the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking GE Refrigerator – Water leaking from your GE fridge is not a cause for panic, leaks from refrigerators are not uncommon and are often simple to fix. The first thing you want to do is identify where the water is pooling, that is a helpful clue as you begin troubleshooting. Then you will want to inspect the door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and icemaker. These parts are the most common culprits when it comes to GE refrigerator leaks.

GE Refrigerator Will Not Run – If the compressor in your GE refrigerator is not running, the appliance will not be able to cool. There are several parts that work together to monitor temperature, and tell the compressor when to run. If any one of those parts is not functioning, the compressor will not run. You should start by checking the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. If you have ruled those parts out, the issue may be with the compressor itself.

GE Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your GE fridge is not making ice, it often indicates there is a water supply issue. Before you start inspecting the water supply and pulling things out of your fridge, we recommend taking a quick look at the bail arm in the icemaker. If the bail arm is stuck, your icemaker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. Once that is ruled out, you will want to take a closer look at the water line, water inlet valve, or the water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is enough water flowing to the icemaker.

GE Refrigerator Too Warm – When your fridge is not cooling properly, it could be as simple as an air circulation problem; it is not always a control board problem. If your GE fridge is properly stocked, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you find no issues there, you should then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

General Electric Refrigerator Water Filter
★★★★★
★★★★★
16 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16217433
Manufacturer Part Number XWFE
This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.

Plastic Auger blades broke in ice tray
I used a digital camera and photographed the assembled unit and the metal blades before I started the repair. Then, I removed the top screw on the clear shield. Flip over ice tray and removed two Phillips screws on bottom. Exterior plastic white cover comes off next. The cover sides have hard push-in white plastic tabs. Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight. Failing to do this will prevent cubed ice from dispensing.

Simple DIY General Electric Refrigerator Fixes

If your GE fridge is not functioning properly, it is a time-sensitive problem. We know you need to get your fridge back up and running as soon as possible to prevent food spoilage. There is no need to panic, most of the common issues you run into with GE refrigerators are easy to troubleshoot and fix. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts fix them.

Noisy GE Refrigerator – It is common to hear noises coming from your GE fridge. There is no need to worry; these issues are simple to identify and fix. It can be as simple as figuring out which area of the refrigerator the noise is coming from or what it sounds like. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. Most often, sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor. Over time the friction and wear and tear can lead to new noises coming from your appliance. For example, if you hear a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans contacting something as it spins. If you hear rattling, make sure the fridge is level, and check that the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking GE Refrigerator – Water leaking from your GE fridge is not a cause for panic, leaks from refrigerators are not uncommon and are often simple to fix. The first thing you want to do is identify where the water is pooling, that is a helpful clue as you begin troubleshooting. Then you will want to inspect the door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and icemaker. These parts are the most common culprits when it comes to GE refrigerator leaks.

GE Refrigerator Will Not Run – If the compressor in your GE refrigerator is not running, the appliance will not be able to cool. There are several parts that work together to monitor temperature, and tell the compressor when to run. If any one of those parts is not functioning, the compressor will not run. You should start by checking the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. If you have ruled those parts out, the issue may be with the compressor itself.

GE Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your GE fridge is not making ice, it often indicates there is a water supply issue. Before you start inspecting the water supply and pulling things out of your fridge, we recommend taking a quick look at the bail arm in the icemaker. If the bail arm is stuck, your icemaker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. Once that is ruled out, you will want to take a closer look at the water line, water inlet valve, or the water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is enough water flowing to the icemaker.

GE Refrigerator Too Warm – When your fridge is not cooling properly, it could be as simple as an air circulation problem; it is not always a control board problem. If your GE fridge is properly stocked, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you find no issues there, you should then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

Haier Refrigerator Light Switch
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8758429
Manufacturer Part Number WR23X10725
The interior light of your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, there could be an issue with the switch. The switch is spring loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is depressed, and continuity through the switch when the button is not depressed. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat blade screwdriver and needle nose pliers.

Sticking Light Switch
I applied some tips learned by reading other reviews. So before I started I grabbed my trusty vise grip pliers and a small screw driver. I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

No power to the fan and compressor
I have a fridge in my garage. I have found that a glass of ice water or a cold drink outside is very important to me. When I discovered melting ice dripping onto the garage floor I was very upset. I spun the fridge and found that the compressor and fan weren't starting. I got out my multi-meter and discovered that power was not making it to these components. I did some research and found the wiring diagram online. There really isn't too much going on with a fridge and the most likely candidate seemed to be the run capacitor. I ordered the part, replaced it in a few minutes and the fridge began working again.

This white full wire shelf is an authentic OEM replacement part for refrigerators. It has dimensions of 10 inches by 15 inches and it is placed along the entire width of the refrigerator compartment. The shelf provides a stable and durable surface for storing food items and its placement can be adjusted according to your needs. Over time the shelf can break, bend, or become warped, due to age or excessive weight. It is important not to overload your shelf as this can lead to premature failure. Replacing the shelf is a simple repair that does not require specialized tools. To remove the old shelf, simply lift it upward to disengage it from the support brackets and pull it out of the refrigerator. Position the new wire shelf on the brackets and ensure it is well aligned.

Haier Refrigerator Light Switch
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8758429
Manufacturer Part Number WR23X10725
The interior light of your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, there could be an issue with the switch. The switch is spring loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is depressed, and continuity through the switch when the button is not depressed. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat blade screwdriver and needle nose pliers.

Jonathan from Lilburn, GA
Sticking Light Switch
I applied some tips learned by reading other reviews. So before I started I grabbed my trusty vise grip pliers and a small screw driver. I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

No power to the fan and compressor
I have a fridge in my garage. I have found that a glass of ice water or a cold drink outside is very important to me. When I discovered melting ice dripping onto the garage floor I was very upset. I spun the fridge and found that the compressor and fan weren't starting. I got out my multi-meter and discovered that power was not making it to these components. I did some research and found the wiring diagram online. There really isn't too much going on with a fridge and the most likely candidate seemed to be the run capacitor. I ordered the part, replaced it in a few minutes and the fridge began working again.

Manufacturer Part Number WR71X28172
This white full wire shelf is an authentic OEM replacement part for refrigerators. It has dimensions of 10 inches by 15 inches and it is placed along the entire width of the refrigerator compartment.

Hardwick Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Hardwick Refrigerator Water Filter

98 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11722130
Manufacturer Part Number EDR4RXD1
This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well. This part should be replaced if it is causing reduced water flow or just replaced periodically per the owner manual. Replacing this water filter may fix a noisy or leaking fridge, a fridge that is not dispensing water (or reduced flow rate), and an ice maker that is not making ice at all, or not making enough ice. This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.

Hardwick Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Started with a grinding noise in the bottom of the dishwasher, and then the thing just stopped cleaning the dishes. It wasn't pumping any water,
I removed the plasic inner parts, used the torx drivers to remove the internal platic plate that covered the sump. Found the food chopper cover and removed it. It had gotten a piece of plastiic wrapped around it. As it spun it had ground the teeth off the end of the drive on the impellor and the food chopper. I replace both as a set and it works fine.

Hardwick Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Installation Instructions
Arau from Haverhill, MA
The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Hoover Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Hoover Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★

183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Hoover Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★

42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted.

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

Loosened the hose clamp, removed the injector valve and injector nozzle assembly, replaced both and tightened with new hose clamp. Fixed the problem for less than $20!! Washing machine is 20 years old and this was the first problem--hopefully it is now good for another 20 years!

Hoover Refrigerator ARM-SHUT
★★★★★

6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12712096
Manufacturer Part Number W11342242
This ice level arm, also known as an ice shutoff arm, is designed to detect the level of ice within the ice bin of your ice maker or refrigerator and turn it off when enough ice has been made. When the ice maker is empty, the arm will be down. When the ice maker is full, the arm will be raised, and over time, wear and tear to the level arm can cause the ice maker to stop making ice completely. To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.

Washing Machine was leaking water
Loosened the hose clamp, removed the injector valve and injector nozzle assembly, replaced both and tightened with new hose clamp. Fixed the problem for less than $20!! Washing machine is 20 years old and this was the first problem--hopefully it is now good for another 20 years!

Hoover Refrigerator ARM-SHUT

6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12712096
Manufacturer Part Number W11342242
This ice level arm, also known as an ice shutoff arm, is designed to detect the level of ice within the ice bin of your ice maker or refrigerator and turn it off when enough ice has been made. When the ice maker is empty, the arm will be down. When the ice maker is full, the arm will be raised, and over time, wear and tear to the level arm can cause the ice maker to stop making ice completely. To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.

Hoover Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★

183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Hoover Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Hoover Refrigerator Bimetal Defrost Thermostat
★★★★★
★★★★★
17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742474
Manufacturer Part Number WP4387503
This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

Hotpoint Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter
★★★★★
★★★★★
82 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746144
Manufacturer Part Number MWFP
This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Tim from Newport News, VA
Plastic Auger blades broke in ice tray
I used a digital camera and photographed the assembled unit and the metal blades before I started the repair. Then, I removed the top screw on the clear shield. Flip over ice tray and removed two Phillips screws on bottom. Exterior plastic white cover comes off next. The cover sides have hard push-in white plastic tabs. Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight. Failing to do this will prevent cubed ice from dispensing.
It is not that hard to do the repair it just takes some patience and paying attention to details.

Fridge too warm, evaporator icing up
After replacing the defrost heater, main board and thermistor I still had the same problem. Called a repair guy and he (with the help of GE on the phone) diagnosed that the temperature sensor was bad. So I ordered from partselect and installed it and it fixed the problem. Been good for a couple months (knocking on wood). To install I had to cut the 2 wires to the old sensor, crimp the 2 new wires on and snap the new sensor to the clip on the evaporator. Very easy. Make sure you seal the ends of the wire crimps so moisture doesn't get in and corrode the connection.

This water inlet valve (Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) supplies water to the ice maker and the water dispenser in your refrigerator. It is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. This replacement part features 1 dual inlet water valve with quick connections. It also has 1/4 and 5/16 John Guest fittings for the outlet lines and a 1/4 compression fitting for the inlet line.

Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working
The very first symptom here is important! The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working. You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect. Undo the connection and press the dispenser. If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door. 2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents. Wait 24 hours. This will usually unfreeze the line. Do not waste your time with a hair dryer. NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first. I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver. A shop towel is helpful for spilled water. A light is handy. Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit. Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply). Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator. On the left you will see the solenoid. It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced. They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar. One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple. Now simply unplug the electrical connections. In my case, one blue ""blade"" type connection (powering the water) and one red ""blade"" type connection powering the ice maker. They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them. pull the tubes clear of the solenoid. This is simple and needs no explantion. Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer). Replace the single screw. Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water. You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water. Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and look really tired when your wife sees that you worked ""so hard""! You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your ""exhausting"" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place. Writing this article took longer! My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!

Hotpoint Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter
★★★★★
★★★★★
82 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746144
Manufacturer Part Number MWFP
This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Plastic Auger blades broke in ice tray
I used a digital camera and photographed the assembled unit and the metal blades before I started the repair. Then, I removed the top screw on the clear shield. Flip over ice tray and removed two Phillips screws on bottom. Exterior plastic white cover comes off next. The cover sides have hard push-in white plastic tabs. Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight. Failing to do this will prevent cubed ice from dispensing.
It is not that hard to do the repair it just takes some patience and paying attention to details.

I removed two srews from the back panel inside fthe reezer compartment and the two that hold the air manifold/baffle? and pulled the baffle out. Then, I removed the two srews that hold the front part of the fan bracket behind the baffle and the back panel came out easily. Two more screws and one quick connect plug attached to the fan and I was done with removal. Insallation was even quicker, I slid the original fan right off the old motor and slid it on the new motor's shaft. Piece of cake! Thanks Partselect.

Fridge too warm, evaporator icing up
After replacing the defrost heater, main board and thermistor I still had the same problem. Called a repair guy and he (with the help of GE on the phone) diagnosed that the temperature sensor was bad. So I ordered from partselect and installed it and it fixed the problem. Been good for a couple months (knocking on wood). To install I had to cut the 2 wires to the old sensor, crimp the 2 new wires on and snap the new sensor to the clip on the evaporator. Very easy. Make sure you seal the ends of the wire crimps so moisture doesn't get in and corrode the connection.

Then, I removed the two srews that hold the front part of the fan bracket behind the baffle and the back panel came out easily. Two more screws and one quick connect plug attached to the fan and I was done with removal. Insallation was even quicker, I slid the original fan right off the old motor and slid it on the new motor's shaft. Piece of cake! Thanks Partselect.

This sensor (Temperature Sensor, Thermistor, Refrigerator Temperature Sensor) sends the temperature reading of the compartment to the control board. If you notice your refrigerator is too warm, too cold, or not defrosting properly, then there may be a problem with your sensor. The temperature sensor can break from material fatigue or through normal use, and should be replaced. It is attached to the evaporator and control housing in your appliance. It measures approximately 1.25 inches long with 18 inch wire leads, and is constructed out of plastic. This part comes in white, beige. It includes the sensor, with wire leads.

Fridge too warm, evaporator icing up
After replacing the defrost heater, main board and thermistor I still had the same problem. Called a repair guy and he (with the help of GE on the phone) diagnosed that the temperature sensor was bad. So I ordered from partselect and installed it and it fixed the problem. Been good for a couple months (knocking on wood). To install I had to cut the 2 wires to the old sensor, crimp the 2 new wires on and snap the new sensor to the clip on the evaporator. Very easy. Make sure you seal the ends of the wire crimps so moisture doesn't get in and corrode the connection.

Hotpoint Refrigerator WATER VALVE WITH GUARD
★★★★★
★★★★★
86 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16226572
Manufacturer Part Number WR57X33326
This water inlet valve (Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) supplies water to the ice maker and the water dispenser in your refrigerator. It is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. This replacement part features 1 dual inlet water valve with quick connections. It also has 1/4 and 5/16 John Guest fittings for the outlet lines and a 1/4 compression fitting for the inlet line.

Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working
The very first symptom here is important! The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working. You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect. Undo the connection and press the dispenser. If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door. 2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents. Wait 24 hours. This will usually unfreeze the line. Do not waste your time with a hair dryer. NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first. I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver. A shop towel is helpful for spilled water. A light is handy. Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit. Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply). Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator. On the left you will see the solenoid. It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced. They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar. One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple. Now simply unplug the electrical connections. In my case, one blue ""blade"" type connection (powering the water) and one red ""blade"" type connection powering the ice maker. They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them. pull the tubes clear of the solenoid. This is simple and needs no explantion. Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer). Replace the single screw. Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water. You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water. Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and look really tired when your wife sees that you worked ""so hard""! You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your ""exhausting"" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place. Writing this article took longer! My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!

If you notice that your refrigerator or freezer is noisy or too warm, you may need to replace the evaporator fan grommet. This part is red in color, and is about 1 inch in diameter. The evaporator fan grommet is located behind the evaporator fan cover in the back of the freezer. You will need to remove the evaporator fan cover to access the evaporator fan and complete this repair. Before you begin this repair, ensure the power to the refrigerator is disconnected. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers, a small flat blade screw driver and both a 1/4 and 5/16-inch nut driver to complete this repair.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

International Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

CYNTHIA from ALPHARETTA, GA
Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

International Refrigerator Bimetal Defrost Thermostat

PartSelect Number PS11742474
Manufacturer Part Number WP4387503
This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

This light switch may also be known as a refrigerator door switch or a light switch kit, and is compatible with your refrigerator. The function of the refrigerator door switch is to turn on the light when your fridge door is open, and to make sure it is off when your refrigerator door is closed. The reason you would need to replace this part is if your light is not turning on when your door is open. For this repair, you will need a putty knife, and a small flat-blade screwdriver.

International Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

International Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

CYNTHIA from ALPHARETTA, GA
Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

International Refrigerator Bimetal Defrost Thermostat
★★★★★
★★★★★
17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742474
Manufacturer Part Number WP4387503
This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.

Installation Instructions
Lawrence from Grahamsville, NY
The frost free feature of the freezer was freezing over with ice and cooling coils were being insulated with thickening frost which caused the cooling air to rise in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees.
I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator problem had passsed through the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly paying close attention to fragile parts.

Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

This is a part that frequently requires multiple parts per refrigerator. Because it is sold individually, you will need to purchase as many door racks as necessary to complete your repair.

Installation Instructions
Colin from Hollis, NY
Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

Installation Instructions
Matthew from Washington, DC
Refrigerator door gasket torn
No instructions included, so it took a little bit of staring at the new part to figure out how it works. The barbed ridge on the gasket fits into a slot on the door. The flat face of the gasket has an internal magnetic strip that helps keep the seal tight against the steel face of the refrigerator. Installation requires no tools. This is the basic process:
1) Unbox the new gasket and get it ready to install so you don't have to leave the fridge open too long.
2) Open the door and grab the old gasket at one of the corners and pull away. This will unseat the barbed ridge I mentioned above. Work your way around the door until the whole gasket is free.
3) Set aside the old gasket
4) Grab a moistened paper towel and wipe down the (now exposed) sealing surface of the fridge and door.
5) Align the new gasket in the door and start pushing the barb into place. I found that the new gasket seemed slightly oversize compared to the original, so it took a little tweaking. What worked for me was to get all the corners seated, then work my way around the door making sure the gasket is fully seated.
6) Once you have the new gasket installed, close the door to make sure everything fits OK.
7) Open the door again and run your finger along the inside edge of the gasket seal. What you want to do is fold the edge of the gasket down so it lays flat against the outer wall of the door.
8) Shut the door and look from the sides and top to try to spot any gaps. You should be able to poke the gasket from the side and get the magnet strips to click into place. It seems like after a day or so the gasket 'relaxed' and I didn't have to worry about this anymore.
9) Dispose of the old gasket. I was able to pull the gasket into four pieces (separating at the corners) so it would fit in my city trash can...

This is a part that frequently requires multiple parts per refrigerator. Because it is sold individually, you will need to purchase as many door racks as necessary to complete your repair.

Installation Instructions
Colin from Hollis, NY
Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

Installation Instructions
Matthew from Washington, DC
Refrigerator door gasket torn
No instructions included, so it took a little bit of staring at the new part to figure out how it works. The barbed ridge on the gasket fits into a slot on the door. The flat face of the gasket has an internal magnetic strip that helps keep the seal tight against the steel face of the refrigerator. Installation requires no tools. This is the basic process:
1) Unbox the new gasket and get it ready to install so you don't have to leave the fridge open too long.
2) Open the door and grab the old gasket at one of the corners and pull away. This will unseat the barbed ridge I mentioned above. Work your way around the door until the whole gasket is free.
3) Set aside the old gasket
4) Grab a moistened paper towel and wipe down the (now exposed) sealing surface of the fridge and door.
5) Align the new gasket in the door and start pushing the barb into place. I found that the new gasket seemed slightly oversize compared to the original, so it took a little tweaking. What worked for me was to get all the corners seated, then work my way around the door making sure the gasket is fully seated.
6) Once you have the new gasket installed, close the door to make sure everything fits OK.
7) Open the door again and run your finger along the inside edge of the gasket seal. What you want to do is fold the edge of the gasket down so it lays flat against the outer wall of the door.
8) Shut the door and look from the sides and top to try to spot any gaps. You should be able to poke the gasket from the side and get the magnet strips to click into place. It seems like after a day or so the gasket 'relaxed' and I didn't have to worry about this anymore.
9) Dispose of the old gasket. I was able to pull the gasket into four pieces (separating at the corners) so it would fit in my city trash can...

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Simple DIY Kenmore Refrigerator Troubleshooting

Kenmore refrigerators are reliable, but when issues spring up we will walk you through how to diagnose and fix them. Most refrigerator fixes are quite simple, you can troubleshoot them yourself. Below we walk you through common issues and the parts that solve them.

Noisy Kenmore Refrigerator – It is not uncommon for a refrigerator to be noisy, but if you notice a new or increasing sound you might want to inspect the issue further. Have you heard buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises coming from your Kenmore refrigerator? You first need to figure out where on the appliance the sound is coming from. There are many moving parts in your Kenmore appliance, such as the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor, and friction and wear over time might lead to the noises. Some specific noises have clear fixes, for example, a scraping sound is caused by one of the internal fans brushing up against something as it spins. If you hear rattling you need to make sure that your Kenmore fridge is level, and the drain pan is secure. Your Kenmore fridge is always going to make some amount of noise, and a mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Kenmore Refrigerator – A leak is not an indication of a major problem with your Kenmore fridge, most often it is a simple fix. You are going to first want to figure out where the water is pooling and look for any indicators that point to the source. For instance, is there condensation inside the fridge? Is there ice build-up that could be melting? Do you have an icemaker that has a water line? You are then going to want to inspect your door gaskets and seals. If the door is not completely sealed it will not only lead to condensation, but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the icemaker.

Kenmore Refrigerator Will Not Run – It might be worrying when you notice that your Kenmore Fridge is not running, but often there can be a simple fix. If the fridge is not running, you will want to troubleshoot things before the temperature starts rising too much. There are a few parts that work together to monitor the internal temperature of your Kenmore fridge and communicate with the control board. You will want to check these parts. We recommend you look at the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, and control board. If the issue is not sensing temperature, or communication of the temperature, it could be an issue with the compressor itself.

Kenmore Icemaker Not Making Ice – If you notice that the icemaker in your Kenmore fridge is not making ice the first thing you should do is check the bail arm in the ice bin. When the bail arm is engaged the icemaker will not make ice because it thinks the bin is full, so a quick check to make sure it is not stuck before beginning the troubleshooting process is wise. If you have ruled that out it is most likely there is an issue with the water supply, if the icemaker is getting no water or not enough water ice will not be made. To check the water supply you will want to inspect the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter.

Kenmore Refrigerator Too Warm – The primary job of your refrigerator is to keep things cool, but if your Kenmore fridge is not cooling properly, it could be a simple fix. Before you start troubleshooting and inspecting parts you should ensure your fridge is stocked properly. If that is not the issue you should then look at the air circulation. You need to confirm the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you have ruled that out you will then want to look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Simple DIY Kenmore Refrigerator Troubleshooting

Kenmore refrigerators are reliable, but when issues spring up we will walk you through how to diagnose and fix them. Most refrigerator fixes are quite simple, you can troubleshoot them yourself. Below we walk you through common issues and the parts that solve them.

Noisy Kenmore Refrigerator – It is not uncommon for a refrigerator to be noisy, but if you notice a new or increasing sound you might want to inspect the issue further. Have you heard buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises coming from your Kenmore refrigerator? You first need to figure out where on the appliance the sound is coming from. There are many moving parts in your Kenmore appliance, such as the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor, and friction and wear over time might lead to the noises. Some specific noises have clear fixes, for example, a scraping sound is caused by one of the internal fans brushing up against something as it spins. If you hear rattling you need to make sure that your Kenmore fridge is level, and the drain pan is secure. Your Kenmore fridge is always going to make some amount of noise, and a mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Kenmore Refrigerator – A leak is not an indication of a major problem with your Kenmore fridge, most often it is a simple fix. You are going to first want to figure out where the water is pooling and look for any indicators that point to the source. For instance, is there condensation inside the fridge? Is there ice build-up that could be melting? Do you have an icemaker that has a water line? You are then going to want to inspect your door gaskets and seals. If the door is not completely sealed it will not only lead to condensation, but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the icemaker.

Kenmore Refrigerator Will Not Run – It might be worrying when you notice that your Kenmore Fridge is not running, but often there can be a simple fix. If the fridge is not running, you will want to troubleshoot things before the temperature starts rising too much. There are a few parts that work together to monitor the internal temperature of your Kenmore fridge and communicate with the control board. You will want to check these parts. We recommend you look at the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, and control board. If the issue is not sensing temperature, or communication of the temperature, it could be an issue with the compressor itself.

Kenmore Icemaker Not Making Ice – If you notice that the icemaker in your Kenmore fridge is not making ice the first thing you should do is check the bail arm in the ice bin. When the bail arm is engaged the icemaker will not make ice because it thinks the bin is full, so a quick check to make sure it is not stuck before beginning the troubleshooting process is wise. If you have ruled that out it is most likely there is an issue with the water supply, if the icemaker is getting no water or not enough water ice will not be made. To check the water supply you will want to inspect the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter.

Kenmore Refrigerator Too Warm – The primary job of your refrigerator is to keep things cool, but if your Kenmore fridge is not cooling properly, it could be a simple fix. Before you start troubleshooting and inspecting parts you should ensure your fridge is stocked properly. If that is not the issue you should then look at the air circulation. You need to confirm the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you have ruled that out you will then want to look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Simple DIY Kenmore Refrigerator Troubleshooting

Kenmore refrigerators are reliable, but when issues spring up we will walk you through how to diagnose and fix them. Most refrigerator fixes are quite simple, you can troubleshoot them yourself. Below we walk you through common issues and the parts that solve them.

Noisy Kenmore Refrigerator – It is not uncommon for a refrigerator to be noisy, but if you notice a new or increasing sound you might want to inspect the issue further. Have you heard buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises coming from your Kenmore refrigerator? You first need to figure out where on the appliance the sound is coming from. There are many moving parts in your Kenmore appliance, such as the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor, and friction and wear over time might lead to the noises. Some specific noises have clear fixes, for example, a scraping sound is caused by one of the internal fans brushing up against something as it spins. If you hear rattling you need to make sure that your Kenmore fridge is level, and the drain pan is secure. Your Kenmore fridge is always going to make some amount of noise, and a mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Kenmore Refrigerator – A leak is not an indication of a major problem with your Kenmore fridge, most often it is a simple fix. You are going to first want to figure out where the water is pooling and look for any indicators that point to the source. For instance, is there condensation inside the fridge? Is there ice build-up that could be melting? Do you have an icemaker that has a water line? You are then going to want to inspect your door gaskets and seals. If the door is not completely sealed it will not only lead to condensation, but it will also overwork your fridge and lead to bigger issues. If you have ruled that out you should also check water inlet valves, water lines, and the icemaker.

Kenmore Refrigerator Will Not Run – It might be worrying when you notice that your Kenmore Fridge is not running, but often there can be a simple fix. If the fridge is not running, you will want to troubleshoot things before the temperature starts rising too much. There are a few parts that work together to monitor the internal temperature of your Kenmore fridge and communicate with the control board. You will want to check these parts. We recommend you look at the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, and control board. If the issue is not sensing temperature, or communication of the temperature, it could be an issue with the compressor itself.

Kenmore Icemaker Not Making Ice – If you notice that the icemaker in your Kenmore fridge is not making ice the first thing you should do is check the bail arm in the ice bin. When the bail arm is engaged the icemaker will not make ice because it thinks the bin is full, so a quick check to make sure it is not stuck before beginning the troubleshooting process is wise. If you have ruled that out it is most likely there is an issue with the water supply, if the icemaker is getting no water or not enough water ice will not be made. To check the water supply you will want to inspect the water line, water inlet valve, and the water filter.

Kenmore Refrigerator Too Warm – The primary job of your refrigerator is to keep things cool, but if your Kenmore fridge is not cooling properly, it could be a simple fix. Before you start troubleshooting and inspecting parts you should ensure your fridge is stocked properly. If that is not the issue you should then look at the air circulation. You need to confirm the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If you have ruled that out you will then want to look at the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor.

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.

Manufacturer Part Number WP2188664
This OEM, clear convertible meat drawer can be used to store meats or vegetables and is designed for the lower portion of your refrigerator, generally. It has its own cold air duct to allow cold air from the freezer to flow into the drawer. You could have a broken or faulty drawer if you find that the food is kept within is spoiling or drying out quickly. The drawer should slide open and closed with ease.

Inspect it for visible damage like cracking or warping, which should be obvious. This part measures approximately 16 7/16 inches wide x 14 5/16 inches deep x 7 5/8 inches high and is a genuine OEM replacement part. It is sold individually. Note that there are several different types and options for the lower vegetable and meat drawers for your refrigerator, and you should check your user manual carefully to ensure that this is the drawer you are looking for.

PartSelect Number PS11738134
Manufacturer Part Number W10874836
This manufacturer-approved Refrigerator Pantry End Cap Kit, also known as the Refrigerator Drawer Support, is a kit containing all parts of the Pantry End Cap. It snaps into place on the appliance’s pantry drawer to help contain the items inside and to keep your refrigerator door from sliding all the way out. It is rated as ""medium"" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Common LG Refrigerator Problems and How to Fix Them

When you are having issues with your LG refrigerator it might seem overwhelming, but there are a lot of simple DIY fixes that will solve your problem. We cover a few of the most common LG refrigerator symptoms, how you should approach them, and the LG fridge parts you will need to fix them. You will have your refrigerator back in working order in no time!

Noisy LG Refrigerator – It can be alarming if you hear new or worsening noises coming from your LG fridge, but often troubleshooting these issues is simple. You will first want to identify the general area the noise is coming from, and what the sound is. Some common sounds that might be coming from your LG fridge are buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking. Most often these sounds are caused by moving parts like the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor. A scraping sound is typically one of the internal fans contacting something as it spins. If your fridge starts making a rattling noise you will want to make sure the appliance is level, and the drain pan is properly secured. It is important to remember that a mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking LG Refrigerator – Water leaking from your LG fridge is not as scary as it seems, most often it is a sign the gaskets and seals are not flush with the appliance. Hot air getting in leads to condensation. It is important to fix this quickly, so you are not overworking other parts of the appliance like the compressor. Anytime you spot a leak you will want to take note where the water is pooling and look for nearby causes, whether it is condensation, or water lines. We always recommend people inspect door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and the icemaker. These are the most common culprits when it comes to LG refrigerator leaks.

LG Refrigerator Will Not Run – When the compressor in your fridge will not run it will not be able to maintain a cool temperature. There are a few parts that work together to monitor and communicate the temperature, and when it reaches a certain point the compressor will run and start the cooling process over again. If any of those parts is not working the compressor might not know when it needs to run. This is why we recommend you start by inspecting the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

LG Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your LG fridge is not making ice it could be as simple as a bail arm being stuck in an engaged position. If the ice maker senses the ice bin is full it will not make more ice. So, before you begin troubleshooting take a quick look in the ice bin to make sure the bail arm is not engaged. Once you have that ruled out you will want to consider if water supply is an issue. We recommend inspecting the water line, water inlet valve, and water filter.

LG Refrigerator Too Warm – Most often when your LG fridge is not cold enough it is a simple fix. This does not always signal a control board issue. The way we suggest you tackle this is by ruling out the simple fixes first. Starting with ensuring that the LG fridge is properly stocked. If that is not a concern you will then want to consider air circulation, if the air is not able to easily circulate it will make it difficult for the fridge to cool or maintain a cool temperature. To do this you will want to make sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked. If that is fine you should then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature senor.

Warranty","Common LG Refrigerator Problems and How to Fix Them

When you are having issues with your LG refrigerator it might seem overwhelming, but there are a lot of simple DIY fixes that will solve your problem. We cover a few of the most common LG refrigerator symptoms, how you should approach them, and the LG fridge parts you will need to fix them. You will have your refrigerator back in working order in no time!

Noisy LG Refrigerator – It can be alarming if you hear new or worsening noises coming from your LG fridge, but often troubleshooting these issues is simple. You will first want to identify the general area the noise is coming from, and what the sound is. Some common sounds that might be coming from your LG fridge are buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking. Most often these sounds are caused by moving parts like the condenser fan motor and evaporator fan motor. A scraping sound is typically one of the internal fans contacting something as it spins. If your fridge starts making a rattling noise you will want to make sure the appliance is level, and the drain pan is properly secured. It is important to remember that a mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking LG Refrigerator – Water leaking from your LG fridge is not as scary as it seems, most often it is a sign the gaskets and seals are not flush with the appliance. Hot air getting in leads to condensation. It is important to fix this quickly, so you are not overworking other parts of the appliance like the compressor. Anytime you spot a leak you will want to take note where the water is pooling and look for nearby causes, whether it is condensation, or water lines. We always recommend people inspect door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and the icemaker. These are the most common culprits when it comes to LG refrigerator leaks.

LG Refrigerator Will Not Run – When the compressor in your fridge will not run it will not be able to maintain a cool temperature. There are a few parts that work together to monitor and communicate the temperature, and when it reaches a certain point the compressor will run and start the cooling process over again. If any of those parts is not working the compressor might not know when it needs to run. This is why we recommend you start by inspecting the start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

LG Icemaker Not Making Ice – If the icemaker in your LG fridge is not making ice it could be as simple as a bail arm being stuck in an engaged position. If the ice maker senses the ice bin is full it will not make more ice. So, before you begin troubleshooting take a quick look in the ice bin to make sure the bail arm is not engaged. Once you have that ruled out you will want to consider if water supply is an issue. We recommend inspecting the water line, water inlet valve, and water filter.

LG Refrigerator Too Warm – Most often when your LG fridge is not cold enough it is a simple fix. This does not always signal a control board issue. The way we suggest you tackle this is by ruling out the simple fixes first. Starting with ensuring that the LG fridge is properly stocked. If that is not a concern you will then want to consider air circulation, if the air is not able to easily circulate it will make it difficult for the fridge to cool or maintain a cool temperature. To do this you will want to make sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked. If that is fine you should then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature senor.","LG Refrigerator Parts

Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Litton Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Litton Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS8746522
Manufacturer Part Number W10613606
This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

PartSelect Number PS2168612
Manufacturer Part Number R0181181
This door closing cam kit is intended for use on the bottom of your refrigerator and freezer door hinges. The cam helps close the doors and to lifts them slightly when opened. If your door will not open or close, or will not stay closed, there could be an issue with the door close cam. Other common symptoms associated with the door close cam are: the door is sweating, the fridge is too warm, or a clicking sound can be heard coming from the door. If your refrigerator has an ice and water dispenser, you will need to disconnect the power and water to the unit before you begin the repair.

Installation Instructions
Russ from Asheville, NC
Door would not close
After emptying the refrig. door, I unscrewed the plate on the top of the refrigerator that covered the door bolts. Then off with the three bolts. I removed the door by lifting it up a few inches. The two parts of the door cam were easily removed and replaced with the new part. BEFORE REPLACING the door spread vasoline on both cam parts.
(Not after as I did. The second time you do any of these repairs go SO much better :o)
After putting the door back on, adjust the tension of the screws holding the door in place if needed to align the door on the cams so that it shuts completely. Failure to do this will require taking the top off the door again. (see comment above on ""... second time..."")
If all is properly aligned, the door should swing completely shut.
Even with the mistakes that required removing the door to lubricate the cams, and removing it AGAIN to readjust the screws on the top to properly align the door on the cams, this was a twenty minute job. My wife and I were still speaking to one another at the end of it- a sure sign of an easy repair.

Installation Instructions
Mark from West Chester, PA
Timer won't advance for auto-sensing cycles. Low Heat.
First I unplugged the dryer from the wall outlet. Then, removed the access panel in the lower front (held on by 2 screws near the floor). Then, I removed the black plastic air duct (held by 3 screws) in front of the blower. Then, with a Sharpie marker, next to each wire terminal lug, I labeled on the chassis the COLOR of each wire where it plugs on to a terminal lug (for proper wiring re-assembly later). Then, thru the lower front, I reached into the lower left rear of the dryer to remove the heating element assembly from its metal duct (held by 3 or 4 screws) - it slides down a bit, then it is easily removable. I layed the element on the floor in front of the dryer - all wiring still intact. Then, using the NEW HEATING ELEMENT and SENSORS ordered, I assembled them to match the original, re-using screws off of the old unit - and moving the wiring one-by-one from the original to the new assembly. I then installed the new heating element assembly into the duct at the lower rear of the dryer. I then replaced the 2 sensors on the front metal panel of blower housing, with new parts from my order, re-using the original wiring and screws. Then I re-installed the black plastic duct onto the front of the blower. Then, on the top of the dryer, I dissassembled the control panel from the rear, by removing 5 screws. I then found the resistor mounted on the back of the timer, and replaced it with the new one. Since the new resistor did not come with terminal lugs crimped on its wires, I had to cut the terminal lugs off of the original resistor and solder them onto the new resistor. I then reassembled the control panel. I then plugged the dryer back into the wall outlet and did a test run with no clothes. IT WORKED !! Then I reinstalled the lower front access panel and ran the dryer with wet clothes. IT WORKED !!

Litton Refrigerator Run Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11743364
Manufacturer Part Number WP65889-4
This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

Frig was hot freezer was cold. Freezer was fronzen over.
The frig was hot but the freezer was cold. I opened the back of the freezer and found the condenser all frozen over. Upon inspecting the defrost thermostat I found that it was split open, as if water got into it and the froze breaking it open. I used a blow dryer to defrost the condenser. I then spent a long time trying to find the model on-line, even the manufactor said it did not exist. Partselect.com was the only place that said the model did exist. When that part came in I toke the back of the freezer out again. Unplugged the defrost thermostat plugged the new one in clipped it back on the condenser and put the it all back together. Everything is working fine now.

Litton Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Litton Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★

183 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Litton Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Litton Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS8746522
Manufacturer Part Number W10613606
This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Installation Instructions
Russ from Asheville, NC
Door would not close
After emptying the refrig. door, I unscrewed the plate on the top of the refrigerator that covered the door bolts. Then off with the three bolts. I removed the door by lifting it up a few inches. The two parts of the door cam were easily removed and replaced with the new part. BEFORE REPLACING the door spread vasoline on both cam parts.
(Not after as I did. The second time you do any of these repairs go SO much better :o)
After putting the door back on, adjust the tension of the screws holding the door in place if needed to align the door on the cams so that it shuts completely. Failure to do this will require taking the top off the door again. (see comment above on ""... second time..."")
If all is properly aligned, the door should swing completely shut.
Even with the mistakes that required removing the door to lubricate the cams, and removing it AGAIN to readjust the screws on the top to properly align the door on the cams, this was a twenty minute job. My wife and I were still speaking to one another at the end of it- a sure sign of an easy repair.

Arau from Haverhill, MA
The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Litton Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
31 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8746522
Manufacturer Part Number W10613606
This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

Gilbert from Clinton, MO
The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

PartSelect Number PS2168612
Manufacturer Part Number R0181181
This door closing cam kit is intended for use on the bottom of your refrigerator and freezer door hinges. The cam helps close the doors and to lifts them slightly when opened. If your door will not open or close, or will not stay closed, there could be an issue with the door close cam. Other common symptoms associated with the door close cam are: the door is sweating, the fridge is too warm, or a clicking sound can be heard coming from the door. If your refrigerator has an ice and water dispenser, you will need to disconnect the power and water to the unit before you begin the repair.

Installation Instructions
Russ from Asheville, NC
Door would not close
After emptying the refrig. door, I unscrewed the plate on the top of the refrigerator that covered the door bolts. Then off with the three bolts. I removed the door by lifting it up a few inches. The two parts of the door cam were easily removed and replaced with the new part. BEFORE REPLACING the door spread vasoline on both cam parts.
(Not after as I did. The second time you do any of these repairs go SO much better :o)
After putting the door back on, adjust the tension of the screws holding the door in place if needed to align the door on the cams so that it shuts completely. Failure to do this will require taking the top off the door again. (see comment above on ""... second time..."")
If all is properly aligned, the door should swing completely shut.
Even with the mistakes that required removing the door to lubricate the cams, and removing it AGAIN to readjust the screws on the top to properly align the door on the cams, this was a twenty minute job. My wife and I were still speaking to one another at the end of it- a sure sign of an easy repair.

Installation Instructions
Mark from West Chester, PA
Timer won't advance for auto-sensing cycles. Low Heat.
First I unplugged the dryer from the wall outlet. Then, removed the access panel in the lower front (held on by 2 screws near the floor). Then, I removed the black plastic air duct (held by 3 screws) in front of the blower. Then, with a Sharpie marker, next to each wire terminal lug, I labeled on the chassis the COLOR of each wire where it plugs on to a terminal lug (for proper wiring re-assembly later). Then, thru the lower front, I reached into the lower left rear of the dryer to remove the heating element assembly from its metal duct (held by 3 or 4 screws) - it slides down a bit, then it is easily removable. I layed the element on the floor in front of the dryer - all wiring still intact. Then, using the NEW HEATING ELEMENT and SENSORS ordered, I assembled them to match the original, re-using screws off of the old unit - and moving the wiring one-by-one from the original to the new assembly. I then installed the new heating element assembly into the duct at the lower rear of the dryer. I then replaced the 2 sensors on the front metal panel of blower housing, with new parts from my order, re-using the original wiring and screws. Then I re-installed the black plastic duct onto the front of the blower. Then, on the top of the dryer, I dissassembled the control panel from the rear, by removing 5 screws. I then found the resistor mounted on the back of the timer, and replaced it with the new one. Since the new resistor did not come with terminal lugs crimped on its wires, I had to cut the terminal lugs off of the original resistor and solder them onto the new resistor. I then reassembled the control panel. I then plugged the dryer back into the wall outlet and did a test run with no clothes. IT WORKED !! Then I reinstalled the lower front access panel and ran the dryer with wet clothes. IT WORKED !!

Litton Refrigerator Run Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11743364
Manufacturer Part Number WP65889-4
This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

Frig was hot freezer was cold. Freezer was fronzen over.
The frig was hot but the freezer was cold. I opened the back of the freezer and found the condenser all frozen over. Upon inspecting the defrost thermostat I found that it was split open, as if water got into it and the froze breaking it open. I used a blow dryer to defrost the condenser. I then spent a long time trying to find the model on-line, even the manufactor said it did not exist. Partselect.com was the only place that said the model did exist. When that part came in I toke the back of the freezer out again. Unplugged the defrost thermostat plugged the new one in clipped it back on the condenser and put the it all back together. Everything is working fine now.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Wanted to install ice maker in my freezer
I was clening my uprght freezer and noticed that it was preped for an icemaker. I first went to the Whilpool website and could not find my part as my freezer was a 2008 model.

I saw PartSelect on the search page and went to thier site.
I put in my modle number of the Whilpool Ice maker kit that was on the back of my freezer. PartSelect had the part in stock and approx $18.00 less than the other kits listed on the Whilpool site (that did not match my kit number). I orderd the kit on Sunday and it arrived on Wednesday. It took less than and hour to install. Every part I needed was included. The following day I installed the water line and now I have an extra icemaker.

Magic Chef Refrigerator Capacitor

PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

If you have ice building up in your freezer, or if your freezer is getting too warm during the defrost cycle you may need to replace the bi-metal defrost thermostat. The function of the defrost bi-metal thermostat is to clip onto the evaporator and protect your evaporator from overheating during the defrost cycle. If your refrigerator does not defrost properly you can test both the thermostat and the heater to figure out which part is at fault. For this repair, you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a 1/4 inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, a pair of wire strippers, a roll of electrical tape, and a few butt splice connectors.

Kevin from Beckley, WV
while closing the door, the light switch fouled, resulting in the switch breaking
I used a flat screwdriver and released the lock tab on the bottom of the light switch, and pried the switch out, being careful to not damage the plastic around the mounting place of the switch, unplugged wiring from old switch, plugged in the new one and pushed the new switch into place. Job finished light switch now working.

PartSelect Number PS2121513
Manufacturer Part Number D7824706Q
This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket. It is located in the freezer section of your appliance, mounted on the freezer wall. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. If this happens, your refrigerator may no longer make ice cubes, or may not make enough cubes, and the part should be replaced. This model measures approximately 11 inches long and 5 inches wide. It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Wanted to install ice maker in my freezer
I was clening my uprght freezer and noticed that it was preped for an icemaker. I first went to the Whilpool website and could not find my part as my freezer was a 2008 model.

I saw PartSelect on the search page and went to thier site.
I put in my modle number of the Whilpool Ice maker kit that was on the back of my freezer. PartSelect had the part in stock and approx $18.00 less than the other kits listed on the Whilpool site (that did not match my kit number). I orderd the kit on Sunday and it arrived on Wednesday. It took less than and hour to install. Every part I needed was included. The following day I installed the water line and now I have an extra icemaker.

Magic Chef Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

If you have ice building up in your freezer, or if your freezer is getting too warm during the defrost cycle you may need to replace the bi-metal defrost thermostat. The function of the defrost bi-metal thermostat is to clip onto the evaporator and protect your evaporator from overheating during the defrost cycle. If your refrigerator does not defrost properly you can test both the thermostat and the heater to figure out which part is at fault. For this repair, you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a 1/4 inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, a pair of wire strippers, a roll of electrical tape, and a few butt splice connectors.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges.

Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Norge Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS11743364
Manufacturer Part Number WP65889-4
This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

Norge Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Manufacturer Part Number WP65889-4
This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

This 40-Watt light bulb is sold individually and is a genuine OEM replacement option for your home appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, so this bulb is compatible with a variety of appliance types including refrigerators, ranges, microwaves, and dryers.

Cleaned the refrigerator as the old parts were removed. Installed new parts as the old parts were removed so as to easily identify the replacement parts. Very easy and wife was extremely happy after old plastic parts self destructed over a period of months and refrigerator was essentially unusable on the bottom two drawers.

PartSelect Number PS1993870
Manufacturer Part Number WR30X10093
This 10 by 5 inch ice maker (Electromechanical Icemaker Kit, Ice Maker Assembly) produces ice. This particular model will produce seven crescent shaped cubes every cycle. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white. This kit includes a set of installation instructions, a 4-pin round plug-in connector, 6 post plug-in connectors, tube and fill cup. The ideal temperature of a freezer is zero degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature in your freezer is at an appropriate level yet ice is still not being made, it could be an issue with the water inlet valve or your ice maker assembly. If you determine it is the ice maker, this is the replacement you need. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage and water quality. This model is mounted on the freezer wall.

ice maker not working properly and door seal worn
Two screws held the icemaker on. You do not even have to take them all the way out to remove the IM. Replacement of the water valve was just as easy except they (parts manufacturer) updated the flange nut with a compression fitting and it took me a minute looking at it before I realize what was going on. The door seal could not be easier, no tools just a few minutes of time

This replacement cover features shallow, wide grooves to prevent leaks and to catch spills. It also has rail brackets underneath to hold the drawer, allowing the drawer to slide in and out. It is made with some added structural rigidity that makes it stronger and more durable than the original. This model measures 24 1/2 inches long x 19 inches wide x 2 5/8 inches deep.

RCA Refrigerator Light Switch

PartSelect Number PS8758429
Manufacturer Part Number WR23X10725
The interior light of your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, there could be an issue with the switch. The switch is spring loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is depressed, and continuity through the switch when the button is not depressed. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat blade screwdriver and needle nose pliers.

Sticking Light Switch
I applied some tips learned by reading other reviews. So before I started I grabbed my trusty vise grip pliers and a small screw driver. I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

Jerry from Whitewright, TX
Door gasket was torn at bottom from food residue
When I did the repair,fortunate for me, a nice repairman was fixing my dishwasher. He said to put the new gasket in the dryer, while I removed the old one, to make it pliable and aid in sealing. I pulled the old gasket out of the retainer clip, cleaned around the area and snapped the new gasket into place(push the raised part into the groove). The repairman said that food residue, especially at the bottom, caused a sticky glue-like film to form. He also advised to put smear vaseline on the new gasket and wipe it off to leave a film. This would aid in sealing and keeping new the gasket from sticking.

Marty from West Bloomfield, MI
Internal water lines brittle, cracked, leaking
First of all, the larger white plastic tubes in this thing are 5/16"" OD, which no plumbing store seems to stock. At the lower left rear end there are 2 tubes, one for water and one for ice, that are doomed to fail being in proximity of a heat source - they essentially get cooked to the point of becoming brittle and cracking. The smaller tube and union can be easily found, but do yourself a favor if the larger one cracks and order the plastic tube and water tube union here, and just cut off the brittle part and amend the old tube using the union.

PartSelect Number PS310869
Manufacturer Part Number WR9X502
This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

RCA Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W
★★★★★

10 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS217532
Manufacturer Part Number 40A15
This 40-Watt light bulb is sold individually and is a genuine OEM replacement option for your home appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, so this bulb is compatible with a variety of appliance types including refrigerators, ranges, microwaves, and dryers. It features a frosted glass bulb with a standard metal socket base, which allows you to easily unscrew the burnt-out light and twist the new bulb into place. Depending on your appliance, there may be a guard or cover protecting the lightbulb, in which case you may require additional tools to remove the cover. We recommend disconnecting the power supply to your appliance before changing the lightbulb.

If you determine it is the ice maker, this is the replacement you need. The ice maker can break from normal wear and accidental damage. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage and water quality. This model is mounted on the freezer wall.

I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute.

Jerry from Whitewright, TX
Door gasket was torn at bottom from food residue
When I did the repair,fortunate for me, a nice repairman was fixing my dishwasher. He said to put the new gasket in the dryer, while I removed the old one, to make it pliable and aid in sealing. I pulled the old gasket out of the retainer clip, cleaned around the area and snapped the new gasket into place(push the raised part into the groove). The repairman said that food residue, especially at the bottom, caused a sticky glue-like film to form. He also advised to put smear vaseline on the new gasket and wipe it off to leave a film. This would aid in sealing and keeping new the gasket from sticking.

Installation Instructions
Marty from West Bloomfield, MI
Internal water lines brittle, cracked, leaking
First of all, the larger white plastic tubes in this thing are 5/16"" OD, which no plumbing store seems to stock. At the lower left rear end there are 2 tubes, one for water and one for ice, that are doomed to fail being in proximity of a heat source - they essentially get cooked to the point of becoming brittle and cracking. The smaller tube and union can be easily found, but do yourself a favor if the larger one cracks and order the plastic tube and water tube union here, and just cut off the brittle part and amend the old tube using the union.

RCA Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 120V 60Hz
★★★★★
★★★★★
7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS310869
Manufacturer Part Number WR9X502
This defrost timer will cycle for 25 minutes after every six hours of run time. The timer itself is made of plastic, and its terminals are bent, the leads are internal, and the label is orange. If you notice that your fridge is too warm, the fridge is running for a long time or is leaking, it could be due to the defrost timer becoming inactive. The defrost timer is found underneath the light cover (may need to remove lightbulb) and will need to be removed along with the air inlet assembly and housing.

Wanda from Cabins, WV
refrigerator was not cooling but the freezer worked fine.
My husband put on the defrost timer. At first I thought the part was not going to fix the problem. After about 5 hours my refrigerator was still warm. I went to work and when I got home that evening my refrigerator was cooling and down to 28 degrees. So if you replace this part wait at least 12-24 hours. Give it time to stablize. My husband says it has to go through its cycle. It works on a 24 hour timer. My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money. My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it. He removed the kick grill and replaced the part. Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer. We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator.

I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition.

249 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS358591
Manufacturer Part Number 4317943
This ice maker (Complete Icemaker Assembly, Whirlpool Icemaker Kit, Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker, Icemaker) receives water from the water inlet valve, freezes it, and dispenses it into the ice bucket until the bucket is full. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage, and water quality. You can perform a voltage test with a multimeter or perform an inlet valve test. If you’re unable to make ice, or notice leaks then it may be a sign your ice maker is damaged and could be in need of a replacement. This model measures approximately 11x5 inches, is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This ice maker is a complete assembly; the whole assembly attaches to the wall of your freezer. ***NOTE: Ice maker does NOT come with the bail or shut off arm. You must order them separately if required. It does come complete with flat and round plug wiring harness, the mounting hardware, and the instructions. The harness can be reused.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Samsung Refrigerator Door Mullion Spring
★★★★★
★★★★★
69 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163672
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01345B
The French door divider spring fits most Samsung French door style refrigerators. The spring applies tension between components in the refrigerator, which engages and retracts the door flap. This will allow the door to close properly. If the spring is broken, damaged, or faulty the door flap will swing open and block the door from closing, and you should look to replace the part straight away to prevent further damage to the door. The spring is a genuine OEM part, is made of metal, and measures at 1 1/2"" long. This part is also known as a refrigerator door mullion spring.

Left side French Door flap on Samsung refrigerator didn't retract when closing.
OMG seriously! I stopped into my go-to appliance repair shop to ask about what might be needed to repair the problem with my refrigerator door. They said you will need to replace the Mullion Flap piece. Cost would be $250-300 with part, labor and service. I went on line to see if I could handle the repair process myself. I found a How to - U Tube video and turns out I only needed to replace a little spring and pin not the whole Mullion Flap. Went to Parts select, ordered the spring and pin and did the repair myself in about 5 minutes. Shipping was $7 so I ended up paying $13 total.

Samsung Refrigerator Spring PIN - French
★★★★★
★★★★★
18 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163673
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01346A
This pin acts as a sleeve for the French door spring in a refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part that is sold individually and works with the spring within the door mullion to seal the door shut. If you need to replace the sleeve, check whether the spring in the door is still intact as well. You will only need to replace one spring sleeve pin per door, as there is only one sleeve on the upper part of the spring. To remove the spring and replace the mullion, do so with a set of needle-nose pliers and lift the lower side of the spring to easily pull it out, then you can replace the sleeve.?

Went to Parts select, ordered the spring and pin and did the repair myself in about 5 minutes. Shipping was $7 so I ended up paying $13 total.

The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Samsung Refrigerator Hinge - French Door
★★★★★
★★★★★
5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4143931
Manufacturer Part Number DA61-03230B
This is a French door hinge that is compatible with various models of refrigerators and is used to control the mullion (long plastic strips) on the inside portion of the French doors. If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.

Evaporator frozen (refrigrator section) and allowing top section to lose cooling
This is the Samsung French door refrigerator style that so many people have complained about freezing up and not cooling the top section. I first changed out the defrost thermostat and this did not correct the problem. I done a quick resistance check on the temp sensor that's mounted on the evaporator itself. The resistance would change when holding an ice cube on the sensor so I just assumed it was ok. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: When performing a resistance check on this sensor, make sure your readings match the Samsung temp/resistance chart in their literature. My sensor was way off calibration and was causing the freeze up. Its working as designed now and DW is happy again. Learn from my mistake.

Samsung Refrigerator French Door Hinge
★★★★★

6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4145262
Manufacturer Part Number DA61-08305A
This French door hinge is an authentic OEM part used in refrigerators. It is used to provide support and stability to the door allowing it to open and close smoothly. The hinge is vulnerable to wear and tear, and mechanical damage over time. A faulty door hinge will result in difficulty opening/closing the door, door misalignment, inadequate sealing, and increased energy consumption. To begin this repair, locate the screws that hold the hinge to the refrigerator frame and remove them. Carefully lift the door off the hinge and set it aside. Remove the faulty hinge and position the new one in its place. Reattach the door to the new hinge and secure the hinge to the refrigerator frame using the appropriate fasteners.

This is an evaporator fan motor for a wide range of Samsung refrigerators. Evaporator fans pull warm air through evaporator coils to cool and maintain the internal temperature of the refrigerator. If the evaporator fan motor in your refrigerator is not working properly, your fridge will not cool properly and may even prevent the ice maker and water dispenser from working, and it will ultimately need to be replaced. This OEM evaporator fan motor measures approximately 4 inches long by 4 inches wide and will need a screwdriver and needle nose pliers to be removed and installed.

James from VISALIA, CA
Main refrigerator was not cooling down adequately.
I looked up a YouTube video and it gave pretty well laid out instructions on how to replace the Twin fan assembly in the main compartment.
There was also a suspicion that the sensor wasn't working properly and the fan had ice on it.
Once I removed the main housing at the back of the inside of refrigerator it was relatively easy to replace the fan motor, and sensor.
You have to follow the disassemble procedure closely in getting the main housing out.
You have to remove the clear plate covering the water filter. Then remove the bottom shelf, which then gives you access to the large white back panel. After that its easy to replace the motor and sensor.

Samsung Refrigerator Door Mullion Spring
★★★★★

69 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4163672
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-01345B
The French door divider spring fits most Samsung French door style refrigerators. The spring applies tension between components in the refrigerator, which engages and retracts the door flap. This will allow the door to close properly. If the spring is broken, damaged, or faulty the door flap will swing open and block the door from closing, and you should look to replace the part straight away to prevent further damage to the door. The spring is a genuine OEM part, is made of metal, and measures at 1 1/2"" long. This part is also known as a refrigerator door mullion spring.

Arau from Haverhill, MA
The door was crocked and wouldn't shut properly
Everything was easy. I read one of your other reviews and it gave me the confidence to try it myself. First i toke off the cap at the top of the door then the three screws. I lifted the door off so i could be sure the cam was my only problem then put the door back on. That took 5 mins. Then I got on the computer and ordered the parts i needed. Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot that i ever had a problem. Thanks for the help.

Samsung Refrigerator Hinge - French Door
★★★★★
★★★★★
5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4143931
Manufacturer Part Number DA61-03230B
This is a French door hinge that is compatible with various models of refrigerators and is used to control the mullion (long plastic strips) on the inside portion of the French doors. If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.

Richard from GULFPORT, MS
Evaporator frozen (refrigrator section) and allowing top section to lose cooling
This is the Samsung French door refrigerator style that so many people have complained about freezing up and not cooling the top section. I first changed out the defrost thermostat and this did not correct the problem. I done a quick resistance check on the temp sensor that's mounted on the evaporator itself. The resistance would change when holding an ice cube on the sensor so I just assumed it was ok. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: When performing a resistance check on this sensor, make sure your readings match the Samsung temp/resistance chart in their literature. My sensor was way off calibration and was causing the freeze up. Its working as designed now and DW is happy again. Learn from my mistake.

Samsung Refrigerator French Door Hinge
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS4145262
Manufacturer Part Number DA61-08305A
This French door hinge is an authentic OEM part used in refrigerators. It is used to provide support and stability to the door allowing it to open and close smoothly. The hinge is vulnerable to wear and tear, and mechanical damage over time. A faulty door hinge will result in difficulty opening/closing the door, door misalignment, inadequate sealing, and increased energy consumption. To begin this repair, locate the screws that hold the hinge to the refrigerator frame and remove them. Carefully lift the door off the hinge and set it aside. Remove the faulty hinge and position the new one in its place. Reattach the door to the new hinge and secure the hinge to the refrigerator frame using the appropriate fasteners.

★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9603956
Manufacturer Part Number DA81-06013A
This is an evaporator fan motor for a wide range of Samsung refrigerators. Evaporator fans pull warm air through evaporator coils to cool and maintain the internal temperature of the refrigerator. If the evaporator fan motor in your refrigerator is not working properly, your fridge will not cool properly and may even prevent the ice maker and water dispenser from working, and it will ultimately need to be replaced. This OEM evaporator fan motor measures approximately 4 inches long by 4 inches wide and will need a screwdriver and needle nose pliers to be removed and installed.

James from VISALIA, CA
Main refrigerator was not cooling down adequately.
I looked up a YouTube video and it gave pretty well laid out instructions on how to replace the Twin fan assembly in the main compartment.
There was also a suspicion that the sensor wasn't working properly and the fan had ice on it.
Once I removed the main housing at the back of the inside of refrigerator it was relatively easy to replace the fan motor, and sensor.
You have to follow the disassemble procedure closely in getting the main housing out.
You have to remove the clear plate covering the water filter. Then remove the bottom shelf, which then gives you access to the large white back panel. After that its easy to replace the motor and sensor.

This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

PartSelect Number PS12712096
Manufacturer Part Number W11342242
This ice level arm, also known as an ice shutoff arm, is designed to detect the level of ice within the ice bin of your ice maker or refrigerator and turn it off when enough ice has been made.

To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.

Sharp Refrigerator Light Bulb - 7W
★★★★★
★★★★★
7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731356
Manufacturer Part Number W10857122
Sold individually. This bulb is a 7-watt appliance incandescent light bulb. This appliance light bulb is two inches long. It is used for many clothes dryers. You will need a Phillips screwdriver and needle-nose pliers. Unplug the power from your dryer. You will find the light bulb by opening your dryer door and locating the casing surrounding the bulb on the top of the inside of the door. You will need to remove the single screw holding it in place to access the bulb. Twist the old bulb out of place. Use your pliers if the base of the bulb is still inside the socket once the glass part of the bulb has been removed. Check to make sure that the socket itself is not damaged. If the socket is damaged it will need to be replaced as well. Screw your new bulb into place.
Installation Instructions
Mark from West Chester, PA
Timer won't advance for auto-sensing cycles. Low Heat.
First I unplugged the dryer from the wall outlet. Then, removed the access panel in the lower front (held on by 2 screws near the floor). Then, I removed the black plastic air duct (held by 3 screws) in front of the blower. Then, with a Sharpie marker, next to each wire terminal lug, I labeled on the chassis the COLOR of each wire where it plugs on to a terminal lug (for proper wiring re-assembly later). Then, thru the lower front, I reached into the lower left rear of the dryer to remove the heating element assembly from its metal duct (held by 3 or 4 screws) - it slides down a bit, then it is easily removable. I layed the element on the floor in front of the dryer - all wiring still intact. Then, using the NEW HEATING ELEMENT and SENSORS ordered, I assembled them to match the original, re-using screws off of the old unit - and moving the wiring one-by-one from the original to the new assembly. I then installed the new heating element assembly into the duct at the lower rear of the dryer. I then replaced the 2 sensors on the front metal panel of blower housing, with new parts from my order, re-using the original wiring and screws. Then I re-installed the black plastic duct onto the front of the blower. Then, on the top of the dryer, I dissassembled the control panel from the rear, by removing 5 screws. I then found the resistor mounted on the back of the timer, and replaced it with the new one. Since the new resistor did not come with terminal lugs crimped on its wires, I had to cut the terminal lugs off of the original resistor and solder them onto the new resistor. I then reassembled the control panel. I then plugged the dryer back into the wall outlet and did a test run with no clothes. IT WORKED !! Then I reinstalled the lower front access panel and ran the dryer with wet clothes. IT WORKED !!

Sharp Refrigerator Run Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11743364
Manufacturer Part Number WP65889-4
This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Ice Dispenser ""round chute"" broken side tab, ice/water fountain not working
I could see that a tab was broken from the round chute that opens for ice dispensing and closes to seal off freezer ice chute when not in use. With the tab broken, the round door would not shut to seal the freezer chute and dispensing water would spatter everywhere. I looked for just the round door part, but is only sold in the ""Ice dispenser solenoid and door kit"" I only had to use the round chute/flap from the kit. The instructions were easy to follow and I had the fridge back working in about 10 minutes. It took me longer to find the right star headed screwdriver that I needed to remove the Maytag star screws (5) total. Because I didn't have to replace the solenoid or the spring mechanism, this was especially easy, and now I have those parts on hand if one day I need them!!

David from Chester, CA
The Bearing Cup Assembly was broken and ice would jamb against it during the ice making cycle.
I removed the ice maker from the refrigerator, by removing one screw on the underside bracket and loosening the two screws at the top side, then lifting the ice maker off the loosened screws. I then unplugged the electrical harness that supplies power from the refrigerator to the ice maker. I then disassembled the ice maker by removing the front cover which is snapped in place, then removing two recessed screws at the front. I removed the broken part, I then reassembled the ice maker with the new part. I replaced the two recessed screws at the front and snapped on the cover. Then I reinstalled the ice maker in the refrigator by plugging in the harness, slipping the ice maker over the loosened screws in the refrigerator and replacing the screw that was removed from the underside bracket. Tightening all the screws completed the project.

This ice maker (Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker) produces ice cubes that are ejected into the storage bucket.

It’s constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/white/silver. This assembly includes the ice mold and the control device.

Installation Instructions
Bernie from Diamond Bar, CA
Icemaker producing few or no cubes and often leaving ""kling-ons"" on ice tray
Interior surface of ice tray felt rough & flaky (coating deteriorated) so cubes would not release.
Unplug appliance.
Remove timer cover by hand pressure @ edge.
Remove single attachment screw & bracket at lower front of icemaker.
Disconnect wiring harness from socket @ rear of compartment.
Tricky part was determining what type of connection held the other two attachment points along the long edge of the icemaker. I did not have repair manual or useful drawing but looked @ PartsDirect pic of side brackets & used a small mirror to confirm that mine were also some sort of ""snap in"" attachment.
Remove icemaker unit by pushing upward and outward on the unit. I takes a good bit of pressure and will pop loose, but be careful not to break attachment bracket from freezer wall.
Scavenge shut off bar and wiring harness from old icemaker once you have it out & attach to new one before installing it back in freezer.
Again, you might find a mirror useful to align those pesky snap-in brackets with the new unit.
Since you probably kept your freezer running while waiting for the part, the plastic snap-ins will be cold and brittle. I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.
A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.
Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.
It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.
Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue.

PartSelect Number PS12712096
Manufacturer Part Number W11342242
This ice level arm, also known as an ice shutoff arm, is designed to detect the level of ice within the ice bin of your ice maker or refrigerator and turn it off when enough ice has been made. When the ice maker is empty, the arm will be down. When the ice maker is full, the arm will be raised, and over time, wear and tear to the level arm can cause the ice maker to stop making ice completely. To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.

PartSelect Number PS11731356
Manufacturer Part Number W10857122
Sold individually. This bulb is a 7-watt appliance incandescent light bulb. This appliance light bulb is two inches long. It is used for many clothes dryers. You will need a Phillips screwdriver and needle-nose pliers. Unplug the power from your dryer. You will find the light bulb by opening your dryer door and locating the casing surrounding the bulb on the top of the inside of the door. You will need to remove the single screw holding it in place to access the bulb. Twist the old bulb out of place. Use your pliers if the base of the bulb is still inside the socket once the glass part of the bulb has been removed. Check to make sure that the socket itself is not damaged. If the socket is damaged it will need to be replaced as well. Screw your new bulb into place.
Installation Instructions
Mark from West Chester, PA
Timer won't advance for auto-sensing cycles. Low Heat.
First I unplugged the dryer from the wall outlet. Then, removed the access panel in the lower front (held on by 2 screws near the floor). Then, I removed the black plastic air duct (held by 3 screws) in front of the blower. Then, with a Sharpie marker, next to each wire terminal lug, I labeled on the chassis the COLOR of each wire where it plugs on to a terminal lug (for proper wiring re-assembly later). Then, thru the lower front, I reached into the lower left rear of the dryer to remove the heating element assembly from its metal duct (held by 3 or 4 screws) - it slides down a bit, then it is easily removable. I layed the element on the floor in front of the dryer - all wiring still intact. Then, using the NEW HEATING ELEMENT and SENSORS ordered, I assembled them to match the original, re-using screws off of the old unit - and moving the wiring one-by-one from the original to the new assembly. I then installed the new heating element assembly into the duct at the lower rear of the dryer. I then replaced the 2 sensors on the front metal panel of blower housing, with new parts from my order, re-using the original wiring and screws. Then I re-installed the black plastic duct onto the front of the blower. Then, on the top of the dryer, I dissassembled the control panel from the rear, by removing 5 screws. I then found the resistor mounted on the back of the timer, and replaced it with the new one. Since the new resistor did not come with terminal lugs crimped on its wires, I had to cut the terminal lugs off of the original resistor and solder them onto the new resistor. I then reassembled the control panel. I then plugged the dryer back into the wall outlet and did a test run with no clothes. IT WORKED !! Then I reinstalled the lower front access panel and ran the dryer with wet clothes. IT WORKED !!

This part helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. If you are noticing temperature issues with your refrigerator or freezer, the run capacitor may need replacing. This repair is fairly easy to complete, and the only tools you will require are a 1/4 inch nut driver, and a 1/4 inch socket with a small ratchet. The run capacitor is located in the back of the fridge, so you will need to make sure you have room to work on this repair. Make sure to unplug the fridge prior to beginning the repair.

The compressor would not run.
I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy.

Ice Dispenser ""round chute"" broken side tab, ice/water fountain not working
I could see that a tab was broken from the round chute that opens for ice dispensing and closes to seal off freezer ice chute when not in use. With the tab broken, the round door would not shut to seal the freezer chute and dispensing water would spatter everywhere. I looked for just the round door part, but is only sold in the ""Ice dispenser solenoid and door kit"" I only had to use the round chute/flap from the kit. The instructions were easy to follow and I had the fridge back working in about 10 minutes. It took me longer to find the right star headed screwdriver that I needed to remove the Maytag star screws (5) total. Because I didn't have to replace the solenoid or the spring mechanism, this was especially easy, and now I have those parts on hand if one day I need them!!

The Bearing Cup Assembly was broken and ice would jamb against it during the ice making cycle.
I removed the ice maker from the refrigerator, by removing one screw on the underside bracket and loosening the two screws at the top side, then lifting the ice maker off the loosened screws. I then unplugged the electrical harness that supplies power from the refrigerator to the ice maker. I then disassembled the ice maker by removing the front cover which is snapped in place, then removing two recessed screws at the front. I removed the broken part, I then reassembled the ice maker with the new part. I replaced the two recessed screws at the front and snapped on the cover. Then I reinstalled the ice maker in the refrigator by plugging in the harness, slipping the ice maker over the loosened screws in the refrigerator and replacing the screw that was removed from the underside bracket. Tightening all the screws completed the project.

★★★★★
★★★★★
78 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS884734
Manufacturer Part Number 8009
This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Rack
★★★★★
★★★★★
89 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS735091
Manufacturer Part Number 240535101
The Door Rack (also known as a retainer bar) is a 23"" white plastic part used to hold small items inside the fridge door. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to determine if this part is correct for you. This is a simple part to repair and should not require any tools. Most customers found it to be very easy to simply snap the old rack out of place and snap the new one back in, making sure the locking tabs are secure. This part is sold individually and not as a part of a kit. It is certified by the original manufacturer.

Tappan Refrigerator Ice Maker Assembly
★★★★★
★★★★★
94 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12364147
Manufacturer Part Number 241798231
This 8-cube ice maker is used to create ice for your refrigerator. The ice maker receives water from the water inlet valve and will freeze until ice cubes are formed. Once the water has been frozen the cubes will be ejected from the mold in to the ice bucket. The ice maker will continue the process until the ice bucket has reached the limit. If your ice maker is not making ice you may need to replace this part. Please remember to disconnect the power and water supply before starting your repair. This ice maker is a genuine OEM part.

Tappan Refrigerator Light Bulb
★★★★★
★★★★★
12 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12751166
Manufacturer Part Number 316538904
This OEM 40 watt appliance light bulb is used for some ranges, refrigerators, freezers, and microwaves. Simply locate the existing bulb, unscrew it from its socket, and replace with new light bulb. If the existing bulb is broken in the socket, disconnect the power to the refrigerator and use a pair of needle nose pliers to grip the internal fragments of the bulb to unscrew. Replace with the new bulb and reconnect the power to the refrigerator. These bulbs are sold individually and are a commonly replaced part; consider ordering a spare.
Installation Instructions
Colin from Hollis, NY
Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Shelf End Cap - Left or Right Side
★★★★★
★★★★★
11 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS422444
Manufacturer Part Number 215267701
This end cap can be used for the right or left side of the refrigerator door shelf or the freezer door shelf. It is white in color, made of plastic material and measures about 2 inches high by 3 inches deep. This might need to be replaced if it has broken or worn over time. This repair requires no tools. You will need to open your fridge, pull upwards on the existing end cap, and pull outwards. There is a locking tab on either end so it does not matter if the top or bottom comes out first. Slide the new end cap onto the rail and it is installed.
Installation Instructions
David from Fleetwood, PA
Freezer / refrigerator warm (not defrosting)
I checked the defrost timer (bottom front of the freezer / outside). I advanced it to send it into the defrost cycle. The heating elements in the freezer (behind the panel) did not heat up. I cut the wires going to the defrost thermostat. Turned the power back on, made sure the defrost timer was still in the defrost cycle and checked the voltage at the wires to the defrost thermostat (before the heating elements). There was power / voltage there. I jumped out / bypassed the defrost thermostat turned the power back on and the heating elements came on. The problem was the defrost thermostat. So I replaced it with a new one from PartSelect.com. How it works...
When the defrost timer is advanced to the defrost cycle the switch closes sending power to the defrost thermostat. If the temperature is low enough, the defrost thermostat switch will close and sends power to the heating elements. When the temperature rises high enough about 55 degrees the switch at the thermostat will open and the heating elements will turn off (not allowing the freezer temperature to get too high, just enough to defrost the coil). The refrigerator will turn back on when the timer advances. The defrost timer will defrost every 8-12 hours.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Handle
★★★★★
★★★★★
48 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS427922
Manufacturer Part Number 218428101
This white handle can be used with both the freezer door and the fresh food door of many refrigerators. Note: As per the manufacturer, this handle includes the mounting block and screw for the top of the handle. If you need the screw for the bottom, it must be ordered separately. This is a simple repair that only requires a Phillips screwdriver. You will remove the 2 screws located on the top of the fridge door and slide the old handle out of place. Take your new handle and use your screwdriver to position back into place.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Shelf End Cap - Left or Right Side
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS422925
Manufacturer Part Number 215473602
The door shelf end cap, or door bin support, secures the rack in a refrigerator or freezer door. Note that this fits on either the left or right hand side. If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.
Installation Instructions
Lynn from New York,, NY
My electric bill was super high. $450 for 1 month for a 1bdrm apt in NY city
I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order. Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws. There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors. I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable.

The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step. They were easy to swap out. You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws. There are alot of them. You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest. Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place. Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws. Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work. You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy. I never even broke a nail.

The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure. They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them. (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it. I will have it in case I need it in the future)

My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made. Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable. I can afford my electric bill now. Thanks for your help.

Tappan Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★
★★★★★
43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Installation Instructions
Stephen from Warrington, PA
Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Ice-Maker and Water Dispenser not working.
First I disconnected the power cord, then removed the screws that held the bracket that holds the base for the water-filer in place. I then disconnected the water lines(intake and outflow). Next I removed the screws that held the water-filter's base in place. I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it.

Replaced the timer with new one. Second I removed all food from freezer. Took of back of freezer wall with nut driver. Located the thermostat which was very easy to remove. Just one clip holding thermostat. Unplugged the two wires from the old thermostat and plugged in new wires. Thanks to Partselect.com, the parts were an exact match. Very easy to do.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Shelf End Cap - Left or Right Side
★★★★★
★★★★★
11 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS422444
Manufacturer Part Number 215267701
This end cap can be used for the right or left side of the refrigerator door shelf or the freezer door shelf. It is white in color, made of plastic material and measures about 2 inches high by 3 inches deep. This might need to be replaced if it has broken or worn over time. This repair requires no tools. You will need to open your fridge, pull upwards on the existing end cap, and pull outwards. There is a locking tab on either end so it does not matter if the top or bottom comes out first. Slide the new end cap onto the rail and it is installed.
Installation Instructions
David from Fleetwood, PA
Freezer / refrigerator warm (not defrosting)
I checked the defrost timer (bottom front of the freezer / outside). I advanced it to send it into the defrost cycle. The heating elements in the freezer (behind the panel) did not heat up. I cut the wires going to the defrost thermostat. Turned the power back on, made sure the defrost timer was still in the defrost cycle and checked the voltage at the wires to the defrost thermostat (before the heating elements). There was power / voltage there. I jumped out / bypassed the defrost thermostat turned the power back on and the heating elements came on. The problem was the defrost thermostat. So I replaced it with a new one from PartSelect.com. How it works...
When the defrost timer is advanced to the defrost cycle the switch closes sending power to the defrost thermostat. If the temperature is low enough, the defrost thermostat switch will close and sends power to the heating elements. When the temperature rises high enough about 55 degrees the switch at the thermostat will open and the heating elements will turn off (not allowing the freezer temperature to get too high, just enough to defrost the coil). The refrigerator will turn back on when the timer advances. The defrost timer will defrost every 8-12 hours.

PartSelect Number PS427922
Manufacturer Part Number 218428101
This white handle can be used with both the freezer door and the fresh food door of many refrigerators. Note: As per the manufacturer, this handle includes the mounting block and screw for the top of the handle. If you need the screw for the bottom, it must be ordered separately. This is a simple repair that only requires a Phillips screwdriver. You will remove the 2 screws located on the top of the fridge door and slide the old handle out of place. Take your new handle and use your screwdriver to position back into place.

Tappan Refrigerator Door Shelf End Cap - Left or Right Side

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS422925
Manufacturer Part Number 215473602
The door shelf end cap, or door bin support, secures the rack in a refrigerator or freezer door. Note that this fits on either the left or right hand side. If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.

My electric bill was super high. $450 for 1 month for a 1bdrm apt in NY city
I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order. Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws. There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors. I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable.

The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step. They were easy to swap out. You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws. There are alot of them. You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest. Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place. Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws. Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work. You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy. I never even broke a nail.

The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure. They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them. (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it. I will have it in case I need it in the future)

My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made. Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable. I can afford my electric bill now. Thanks for your help.

Tappan Refrigerator Defrost Timer - 60Hz 120V
★★★★★
★★★★★
43 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS423801
Manufacturer Part Number 215846602
This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.

Fridge got warm and freezer coils were frosted
Fridge is a side by side. The freezer is pretty narrow for a guy with wide shoulders.

Pulled plug.

Had to remove bottom drawers then used nut driver to remove screws closest to back wall in drawer runners. Once the back screws were removed the runners could be swung up or down out of way so back cover could be removed.

Once back cover was removed thermostat was located attached to top pipe going into coil using a spring clamp.

Cut the wires just outside the crimp connectors going into thermostat. Released the spring clamp buy squeezing botton together.

Removed old badly corroded thermostat.

I wish I had attached the crimp connectors to the new thermostat wires before mounting it. Reaching way in the back, while turning shoulders verticly and trying to get the wire connectors set from both sides was awkward and uncomfortable...The biggest PIA of the whole task.

Once connected I let the fridge (thermostat) cool for 10 min. Turned the dial defrost timer to get it into defrost mode. Stupidly touched the heating element to see if it was getting warm...it was very hot.

Coils steamed...every looked like it was working. Unplugged, put back cover back on and retattached drawer mounts.

Plugged back in and everying is working great!

Thermador Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
249 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS358591
Manufacturer Part Number 4317943
This ice maker (Complete Icemaker Assembly, Whirlpool Icemaker Kit, Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker, Icemaker) receives water from the water inlet valve, freezes it, and dispenses it into the ice bucket until the bucket is full. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage, and water quality. You can perform a voltage test with a multimeter or perform an inlet valve test. If you’re unable to make ice, or notice leaks then it may be a sign your ice maker is damaged and could be in need of a replacement. This model measures approximately 11x5 inches, is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This ice maker is a complete assembly; the whole assembly attaches to the wall of your freezer. ***NOTE: Ice maker does NOT come with the bail or shut off arm. You must order them separately if required. It does come complete with flat and round plug wiring harness, the mounting hardware, and the instructions. The harness can be reused. The ice maker will not fit refrigerators that have the ice auger mounted on the door.

Lifted the front up onto a scrap 2x4 to get it off the ground and it had 1 bolt that you removed to get the old item off and replace with new assymbly and 1 bolt to re attach. This sat broke for over a year becuase I thought it would be alot harder to fix, found the part on parts select ordered it recieved it in approx 2 days and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. I would recommend parts select to anyone who told me that they had a appliance broken.

PartSelect Number PS11739026
Manufacturer Part Number WP2180224
This is a refrigerator ice guide that is made entirely of clear plastic. This ice guide is located in the freezer door. Turn your refrigerator ice dispenser off before replacing the part. This is a simple repair, and the only tool you will need is a small flat blade screwdriver to push on the pivot tab on the bottom of the ice guide. Do not worry about breaking the side or pivot tabs on your existing ice guide because it will be discarded anyway. This is a genuine manufacturer replacement part.

External Ice Guide Broke a Tooth and Fell Off
We waited two years to do this because we didn't want to hassle with a repair man to come out and charge us arm+leg for something so simple. Finally we searched and found the part on line. It came two days FASTER than promised. Kudos to Part Select.
Snapping it on was a breeze, although you do have to apply more pressure than feels comfortable with plastic clips. We can know get ice out of the external door system again.

Edward from Andover, NJ
Dryer was sqeaking loudly when running
I Looked on internet sites for this type of problem.
Most sites said the support rollers could cause this.
I found your site PartSelect and with help of your diagrams of the machine ordered the parts I thought were needed plus other parts that might cause the problem.
With machine torn down I replaced the rollers.
I had also ordered the main drive belt and idler assembly with the rollers and these also needed replacement. It is a good idea to order other suspect parts when doing this type of repair since you can return the parts not needed.
Your return policy is great.

Thermador Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Water dispenser not working, Ice dispenser chute icing up
I removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover following directions I found on-line (push down and gently pry out at the bottom). I then removed several nut-head screws which were holding a plastic plate which had the door light and electric control wiring mounted in it. Behind that I found a broken tab on the Control Bracket which was why my water dispencer was not working and I found the chute door for the ice maker was chewed up which allowed warm air into the chute and was causing my ice build up problem. Replacing the Control Bracket was easy. Just note how things come apart. Putting the chute door in was a little more complicated, but again, note how things come apart and you should not have a problem putting it back together.

This part is a replacement refrigerator drive shaft seal for your refrigerator. The drive shaft seal protects the auger motor from water and condensation that may leak down the drive shaft from the ice bucket. If the seal is broken, water and condensation can get in, causing the ice maker to fail. To replace the seal, first remove the ice bucket from your freezer. Then remove the two screws on the drive shaft holder, and use a pair of pliers to remove the drive shaft. At this point you can remove the seal from the drive shaft. Be sure to clean the area that the seal sits in before you reinstall the drive shaft. This part is white in color and is about an inch in diameter. The seal is sold individually.

Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan
Our 48"" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago. Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not. It was simple to replace. Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan. Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient. I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long. Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself! Thank you PartSelect!

Thermador Refrigerator Replacement Ice Maker
★★★★★
★★★★★
249 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS358591
Manufacturer Part Number 4317943
This ice maker (Complete Icemaker Assembly, Whirlpool Icemaker Kit, Ice Maker Assembly, Refrigerator Ice Maker, Icemaker) receives water from the water inlet valve, freezes it, and dispenses it into the ice bucket until the bucket is full. Ice makers will need to be replaced every 3-10 years depending on the frequency of usage, and water quality. You can perform a voltage test with a multimeter or perform an inlet valve test. If you’re unable to make ice, or notice leaks then it may be a sign your ice maker is damaged and could be in need of a replacement. This model measures approximately 11x5 inches, is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This ice maker is a complete assembly; the whole assembly attaches to the wall of your freezer. ***NOTE: Ice maker does NOT come with the bail or shut off arm. You must order them separately if required. It does come complete with flat and round plug wiring harness, the mounting hardware, and the instructions. The harness can be reused. The ice maker will not fit refrigerators that have the ice auger mounted on the door.

Thermador Refrigerator Ice Guide

PartSelect Number PS11739026
Manufacturer Part Number WP2180224
This is a refrigerator ice guide that is made entirely of clear plastic. This ice guide is located in the freezer door. Turn your refrigerator ice dispenser off before replacing the part. This is a simple repair, and the only tool you will need is a small flat blade screwdriver to push on the pivot tab on the bottom of the ice guide. Do not worry about breaking the side or pivot tabs on your existing ice guide because it will be discarded anyway. This is a genuine manufacturer replacement part.

External Ice Guide Broke a Tooth and Fell Off
We waited two years to do this because we didn't want to hassle with a repair man to come out and charge us arm+leg for something so simple. Finally we searched and found the part on line. It came two days FASTER than promised. Kudos to Part Select.
Snapping it on was a breeze, although you do have to apply more pressure than feels comfortable with plastic clips. We can know get ice out of the external door system again.

Edward from Andover, NJ
Dryer was sqeaking loudly when running
I Looked on internet sites for this type of problem.
Most sites said the support rollers could cause this.
I found your site PartSelect and with help of your diagrams of the machine ordered the parts I thought were needed plus other parts that might cause the problem.
With machine torn down I replaced the rollers.
I had also ordered the main drive belt and idler assembly with the rollers and these also needed replacement. It is a good idea to order other suspect parts when doing this type of repair since you can return the parts not needed.
Your return policy is great.

Thermador Refrigerator Capacitor
★★★★★
★★★★★
42 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757023
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10662129
This capacitor (Refrigerator and Freezer Compressor Run Capacitor, Run Capacitor) provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating. If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.

garth from forest lake, MN
My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer section stopped freezing
I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!

Water dispenser not working, Ice dispenser chute icing up
I removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover following directions I found on-line (push down and gently pry out at the bottom). I then removed several nut-head screws which were holding a plastic plate which had the door light and electric control wiring mounted in it. Behind that I found a broken tab on the Control Bracket which was why my water dispencer was not working and I found the chute door for the ice maker was chewed up which allowed warm air into the chute and was causing my ice build up problem. Replacing the Control Bracket was easy. Just note how things come apart. Putting the chute door in was a little more complicated, but again, note how things come apart and you should not have a problem putting it back together.

Thermador Refrigerator Seal
★★★★★

5 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11739241
Manufacturer Part Number WP2198628
This part is a replacement refrigerator drive shaft seal for your refrigerator. The drive shaft seal protects the auger motor from water and condensation that may leak down the drive shaft from the ice bucket. If the seal is broken, water and condensation can get in, causing the ice maker to fail. To replace the seal, first remove the ice bucket from your freezer. Then remove the two screws on the drive shaft holder, and use a pair of pliers to remove the drive shaft. At this point you can remove the seal from the drive shaft. Be sure to clean the area that the seal sits in before you reinstall the drive shaft. This part is white in color and is about an inch in diameter. The seal is sold individually.

Uni Refrigerator Upper or Lower Mullion Hinge Pin
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

Uni Refrigerator Upper or Lower Mullion Hinge Pin
★★★★★
★★★★★
6 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2358752
Manufacturer Part Number 241779401
This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.

One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Troubleshooting Whirlpool Refrigerator Issues and Common Fixes

Any issue with your refrigerator might seem overwhelming, but we are here to help you get to the bottom of the problem. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts that fix them.

Noisy Whirlpool Refrigerator – Hearing new or louder sounds from your refrigerator might be alarming. Often there is a simple explanation and an easy fix. Before spending too much time worrying, me time to really listen to where the noise is coming from. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. If you notice a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans making contact with something as it spins. If you hear rattling check the fridge is level, and make sure the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked. If it is not one of these noises you should keep in mind that often fridge sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor.

Leaking Whirlpool Refrigerator – If you notice water leaking from your fridge, or inside, there is no need to panic, most often these leaks are simple to fix. Troubleshooting a leaking Whirlpool refrigerator starts with identifying where you find the water pooling. Our recommendation is to first inspect your door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and ice maker. These parts are the most common culprits when it comes to refrigerator leaks.

Whirlpool Refrigerator Will Not Run – If the compressor in your Whirlpool fridge will not run the appliance will not cool, which is the main function of a fridge. This is a problem, but there is no need to panic. It could be as simple as an issue with your start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. These parts monitor internal temperature and communicate with the compressor. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Whirlpool Icemaker Not Making Ice – Before you start troubleshooting issues with your Whirlpool icemaker, we recommend you take a quick look inside to make sure the bail arm is not stuck. If it is, your icemaker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. If it is not the bail arm the most likely explanation is the Whirlpool icemaker is not getting the water it needs to operate. There are a few parts that could be contributing to that issue, such as the water line, water inlet valve, or a water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is water flowing to the icemaker and allow you to spot any issues with the water supply.

Whirlpool Refrigerator Too Warm – It can be worrying when your fridge is not cooling properly, but it does not always indicate big problems like a faulty control board. If your Whirlpool fridge is not overstocked, which can be one cause of this problem, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation in the appliance. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If that is fine you will need to then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor. It is also important to ensure you are routinely cleaning the condenser coils to help prevent issues like this.

Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.

Tim from Littleton, CO
The poorly designed deli drawer lid tab broke off
Removed the fruit & veggie drawers & the deli (pantry) drawer. Took out the 3 screws, removed the attached parts, put them on the replacement part, reattached it and put the drawers back in.

Here's the part I want to share: PartSelect had a expanded diagram showing the correct part and sufficiently detailed to figure out the repair before the part arrived. That's why I ordered from them. Secondly, I ordered the part Thursday morning--and the thing was sitting on my porch when I came back in from my evening out Saturday--2 days later!!!

Troubleshooting Whirlpool Refrigerator Issues and Common Fixes

Any issue with your refrigerator might seem overwhelming, but we are here to help you get to the bottom of the problem. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts that fix them.

Noisy Whirlpool Refrigerator – Hearing new or louder sounds from your refrigerator might be alarming. Often there is a simple explanation and an easy fix. Before spending too much time worrying, me time to really listen to where the noise is coming from. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. If you notice a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans making contact with something as it spins. If you hear rattling check the fridge is level, and make sure the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked. If it is not one of these noises you should keep in mind that often fridge sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor.

Leaking Whirlpool Refrigerator – If you notice water leaking from your fridge, or inside, there is no need to panic, most often these leaks are simple to fix. Troubleshooting a leaking Whirlpool refrigerator starts with identifying where you find the water pooling. Our recommendation is to first inspect your door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and ice maker. These parts are the most common culprits when it comes to refrigerator leaks.

Whirlpool Refrigerator Will Not Run – If the compressor in your Whirlpool fridge will not run the appliance will not cool, which is the main function of a fridge. This is a problem, but there is no need to panic. It could be as simple as an issue with your start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. These parts monitor internal temperature and communicate with the compressor. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Whirlpool Icemaker Not Making Ice – Before you start troubleshooting issues with your Whirlpool icemaker, we recommend you take a quick look inside to make sure the bail arm is not stuck. If it is, your icemaker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. If it is not the bail arm the most likely explanation is the Whirlpool icemaker is not getting the water it needs to operate. There are a few parts that could be contributing to that issue, such as the water line, water inlet valve, or a water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is water flowing to the icemaker and allow you to spot any issues with the water supply.

Whirlpool Refrigerator Too Warm – It can be worrying when your fridge is not cooling properly, but it does not always indicate big problems like a faulty control board. If your Whirlpool fridge is not overstocked, which can be one cause of this problem, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation in the appliance. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If that is fine you will need to then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature sensor. It is also important to ensure you are routinely cleaning the condenser coils to help prevent issues like this.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Before spending too much time worrying, me time to really listen to where the noise is coming from. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. If you notice a scraping sound it is often caused by one of the internal fans making contact with something as it spins. If you hear rattling check the fridge is level, and make sure the drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked. If it is not one of these noises you should keep in mind that often fridge sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, such as the condenser fan motor, or the evaporator fan motor.

Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker.

The Door Shelf Retainer Bar, also known as a refrigerator door rack, is a white, plastic part which can be easily installed onto your fridge door.

82 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2358880
Manufacturer Part Number 241993101
This crisper cover front support is used to keep the crisper shelf in place and may need replacing if the door will not open or close. This white, OEM part measures roughly 1 inch in diameter and can be used for the front and the rear support, as designed by the manufacturer, and mounts to the inside cabinet wall. Replacing this part is an easy repair, and will require a small flat blade screwdriver, a putty knife, and a soft hammer. Remove the crisper and shelf from the refrigerator before replacing the support. The crisper cover front support is held in place with a locking pin. To remove the old part, you will first need to push the pin into the interior of the cabinet using the screwdriver, and then you can pull the support out with a putty knife. If you cannot get the pin out you can use a flat-blade screwdriver to push it down and out of sight and it will not harm anything in your refrigerator After removing the pin and attaching the new support, simply use the soft hammer to lock the new pin in place.

Erik from Evans, GA
Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers.

This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.

PartSelect Number PS7784018
Manufacturer Part Number 242252702
The function of the Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve (Triple Solenoid Water-Valve, Water Valve, Water Inlet Valve, Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) is to release water from the supply line when activated, and send it through to your water dispenser or ice maker in your refrigerator. The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use.

The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the valve assembly in place. I took the water valve out and removed the electrical connections as well as the plastic tubing which feed the water dispenser and the ice maker. To install the new water valve it was just a matter of reversing steps.

How to change the water filter of my refrigerator?
For model number LFSS2612TF0
Hello Fernando, thank you for reaching out. The water filter is located on the top right side of the refrigerator compartment. Use the following instructions to replace the water filter: 1. Turn off the ice maker. 2. Remove the filter by pushing on the end of the filter. 3. Slide the old water filter cartridge straight out of the housing and discard it. 4. Unpackage the new filter cartridge. Using the alignment guide, slide it gently into the filter housing until it stops against the snap-in connector at the back of the housing. 5. Push firmly until the cartridge snaps into place (you should hear a click as the cartridge engages the snap-in connector). 6. Press a drinking glass against the water dispenser while checking for any leaks at the filter housing. Any spurts and sputters that occur as the system purges air out of the dispenser system are normal. 7. After filling one glass of water, continue flushing the system for about four minutes. 8. Turn On the ice maker. 9. Press and hold the water filter button on the ice and water dispenser control panel for three seconds. When the display changes from ""Red"" to ""Green,"" the status has been reset. We hope this information helps!

How to change the water filter of my refrigerator?
For model number LFSS2612TF0
Hello Fernando, thank you for reaching out. The water filter is located on the top right side of the refrigerator compartment. Use the following instructions to replace the water filter: 1. Turn off the ice maker. 2. Remove the filter by pushing on the end of the filter. 3. Slide the old water filter cartridge straight out of the housing and discard it. 4. Unpackage the new filter cartridge. Using the alignment guide, slide it gently into the filter housing until it stops against the snap-in connector at the back of the housing. 5. Push firmly until the cartridge snaps into place (you should hear a click as the cartridge engages the snap-in connector). 6. Press a drinking glass against the water dispenser while checking for any leaks at the filter housing. Any spurts and sputters that occur as the system purges air out of the dispenser system are normal. 7. After filling one glass of water, continue flushing the system for about four minutes. 8. Turn On the ice maker. 9. Press and hold the water filter button on the ice and water dispenser control panel for three seconds. When the display changes from ""Red"" to ""Green,"" the status has been reset. We hope this information helps!

On the refrigerator temperature set point it has a 4 it’s set at 35 degrees Fahrenheit I had to do a reset after the power surging . It seems to be working however it was only a few hours ago I reset it .. I had stopped working all together.. Thank you!!
For model number FGHS2631PF4A
Hello Dennis, thank you for contacting us. The issue is most probably related to a faulty temperature sensor, part number PS1765215. If this does not solve the problem, we would recommend checking the main control board, part number PS10062915, with a multimeter to pinpoint the fault. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!

On the refrigerator temperature set point it has a 4 it’s set at 35 degrees Fahrenheit I had to do a reset after the power surging . It seems to be working however it was only a few hours ago I reset it .. I had stopped working all together.. Thank you!!
For model number FGHS2631PF4A
Hello Dennis, thank you for contacting us. The issue is most probably related to a faulty temperature sensor, part number PS1765215. If this does not solve the problem, we would recommend checking the main control board, part number PS10062915, with a multimeter to pinpoint the fault. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!

The led at the top of refrigerator is dim. Assume it needs replacing. Have looked at it and not sure how it is removed. How do you remove the light.
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello Frank, Thank you for the question. You will need to use a thin flat head screwdriver to depress the tabs around the edge of the Light. Unplug the wire harness and plug into the new light and snap it in place. Hope this helps!

None of my lights are working in the fridge or freezer. What would cause this?
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello Dale, thank you for your question. That would be caused by a bad LED light control module which is the main LED light in the fridge section. We would recommend replacing PartSelect Number: PS11755867. I hope this helps.

All lights in my fridge and freezer just went out everything still is working (as in keeping things cold) but not lights don’t come on.
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello and thank you for writing. As it is unlikely that both led lights PS11755866 went faulty at the same time, it is likely to be a defective led control board PS11755867, check and replace if needed. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

The led at the top of refrigerator is dim. Assume it needs replacing. Have looked at it and not sure how it is removed. How do you remove the light.
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello Frank, Thank you for the question. You will need to use a thin flat head screwdriver to depress the tabs around the edge of the Light. Unplug the wire harness and plug into the new light and snap it in place. Hope this helps!

Hi, The led light located on the ceiling of the refrigerator side is flickering and does not light.Is this part hard to replace? could it just be the switch? i could not find the light in the parts catalog. thanks for your help!
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello Dan and thank you for writing. It usually indicates a faulty switch PS11738900. Check for damage and replace it if needed. It is a relatively easy repair, here is our video to give you an idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV8lfb4cyE&feature=emb_title We hope this helps.

None of my lights are working in the fridge or freezer. What would cause this?
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello Dale, thank you for your question. That would be caused by a bad LED light control module which is the main LED light in the fridge section. We would recommend replacing PartSelect Number: PS11755867. I hope this helps.

All lights in my fridge and freezer just went out everything still is working (as in keeping things cold) but not lights don’t come on.
For model number WRS325FDAM04
Hello and thank you for writing. As it is unlikely that both led lights PS11755866 went faulty at the same time, it is likely to be a defective led control board PS11755867, check and replace if needed. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

Trying to trouble shoot why I am not getting water from the water dispenser.
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Jory, Thank you for the question. The water inlet valve opens to supply water to the dispenser. If the water inlet valve is defective, or if the water pressure is too low, the water valve will not open. Make sure that the water pressure to the valve is at least 20 psi. We hope this helps.

Why is ice building up on the bottom of the freezer
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Adele, Thank you for your inquiry. It could be caused by a clogged drain fitting, which is allowing the water to pool on the bottom of the freezer. We would recommend checking the drain fitting, the drain tube/trivet and the evaporator drain pan. Check for any clogs and excess water in the pan. Good luck with your repair.

Water dispenser works fine without filter, I bought a new filter bled the air and it only dispenses a trickle of water. Any suggestions?
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Leroy, thank you for your inquiry. We advice to check to make sure the Water Filter PS11701542 is fitted correctly and I would check the lines connected to it to see if they are cracked and fitted correctly. Check the Water Inlet Valve PS11749668 as well to make sure if it is working correctly. We hope this is of some help to you.

Trying to trouble shoot why I am not getting water from the water dispenser.
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Jory, Thank you for the question. The water inlet valve opens to supply water to the dispenser. If the water inlet valve is defective, or if the water pressure is too low, the water valve will not open. Make sure that the water pressure to the valve is at least 20 psi. We hope this helps.

Why is ice building up on the bottom of the freezer
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Adele, Thank you for your inquiry. It could be caused by a clogged drain fitting, which is allowing the water to pool on the bottom of the freezer. We would recommend checking the drain fitting, the drain tube/trivet and the evaporator drain pan. Check for any clogs and excess water in the pan. Good luck with your repair.

Water dispenser works fine without filter, I bought a new filter bled the air and it only dispenses a trickle of water. Any suggestions?
For model number WRS325FDAM02
Hello Leroy, thank you for your inquiry. We advice to check to make sure the Water Filter PS11701542 is fitted correctly and I would check the lines connected to it to see if they are cracked and fitted correctly. Check the Water Inlet Valve PS11749668 as well to make sure if it is working correctly. We hope this is of some help to you.

The door switch for the light broke, I removed the damaged one to confirm it matched the purchase and then replaced. When pushing the water button or the ice button it clicks but neither will operate.
For model number MFI2568AES
Hello J, thank you for your inquiry. According to our research, the issue is most probably with the dispenser control board, part number PS12349472. It controls the water and ice dispenser operations in the refrigerator door. You may need to replace it to solve the problem. Glad to be of help!

Front control panel will not work. The lights are stuck on cube, door alarm, and reset filter button will not reset.
For model number MFI2568AES
Hello Cindy, Thank you for the question. When the front Panel is not allowing you to change functions, it is normally an indication the Low Voltage Dispenser Control Board will need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

The door switch for the light broke, I removed the damaged one to confirm it matched the purchase and then replaced. When pushing the water button or the ice button it clicks but neither will operate.
For model number MFI2568AES
Hello J, thank you for your inquiry. According to our research, the issue is most probably with the dispenser control board, part number PS12349472. It controls the water and ice dispenser operations in the refrigerator door. You may need to replace it to solve the problem. Glad to be of help!

How do i level the cabinet of door on this model. The left door is lower than the right door. I search for videos but could not find any for this model.
For model number WRF535SMBM00
Hello Tyrone, Thank you for your question. Our sources suggest that the only part that is likely causing the left door to not be level is the door hinge under part PS11738657 for your model. We hope this helps!

How do i level the cabinet of door on this model. The left door is lower than the right door. I search for videos but could not find any for this model.
For model number WRF535SMBM00
Hello Tyrone, Thank you for your question. Our sources suggest that the only part that is likely causing the left door to not be level is the door hinge under part PS11738657 for your model. We hope this helps!

My freezer keeps thawing and refreezing every few weeks. I constantly have to clean out the ice that builds up on the bottom. Sometimes I can see the seal on the door is not closing all the way but then after I get it to stop doing that(usually after about 2-3weeks) it seems fine. Then after another few weeks it starts doing this again.
For model number WRX735SDBM00
Hello JJ, Thank you for the question. If the gasket is not sealing it will allow warm air in and cause issues with the Defrost Cycle. We hope this helps!

Hello Doc, Thank you for your question. It sounds like either the filter cover under part PS11743682 is damaged where it connects to the bracket tabs, or the bracket itself under part PS2069868 is damaged and would need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

Ice maker does not dispense ice after water freezes
For model number WRX735SDBM00
Hello George, thank you for contacting us. An auger motor will spin an auger blade to push the ice out of the ice bucket and down the dispenser ice chute. You may need to replace the auger motor, part number PS11752533, to fix your issue. We hope this helps.

Was this instruction helpful to you?
Removing the existing filter by rotating as directed and then dislodging from 'docking' station proved difficult. Turns out, the old filter is under a bit of vacuum pressure and getting the unit to separate or release was a challenge.
I removed the drop-down outer housing by gently prying the sides of the two pivot pins at the rear. This gave me move 'room' to grip and slightly rotate then pull the old filter forward and away from the tight suction connection. I was concerned that I would be too forceful for the plastic assemblies and would break something; deliberate ... Read more

JJ
July 15, 2021
My freezer keeps thawing and refreezing every few weeks. I constantly have to clean out the ice that builds up on the bottom. Sometimes I can see the seal on the door is not closing all the way but then after I get it to stop doing that(usually after about 2-3weeks) it seems fine. Then after another few weeks it starts doing this again.
For model number WRX735SDBM00
Hello JJ, Thank you for the question. If the gasket is not sealing it will allow warm air in and cause issues with the Defrost Cycle. We hope this helps!

Hello Doc, Thank you for your question. It sounds like either the filter cover under part PS11743682 is damaged where it connects to the bracket tabs, or the bracket itself under part PS2069868 is damaged and would need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

Ice maker does not dispense ice after water freezes
For model number WRX735SDBM00
Hello George, thank you for contacting us. An auger motor will spin an auger blade to push the ice out of the ice bucket and down the dispenser ice chute. You may need to replace the auger motor, part number PS11752533, to fix your issue. We hope this helps.

Was this instruction helpful to you?
Removing the existing filter by rotating as directed and then dislodging from 'docking' station proved difficult. Turns out, the old filter is under a bit of vacuum pressure and getting the unit to separate or release was a challenge.
I removed the drop-down outer housing by gently prying the sides of the two pivot pins at the rear. This gave me move 'room' to grip and slightly rotate then pull the old filter forward and away from the tight suction connection. I was concerned that I would be too forceful for the plastic assemblies and would break something; deliberate ... Read more

How do I remove the plastic light casing to replace my refrigerator light?
For model number GFSS2HCYCSS
Hi Kandis, thank you for reaching out. You need to follow the following instructions to replace the light in the refrigerator: 1. Unplug the power to the appliance. 2. Open the refrigerator door to locate the light shield. 3. To remove the light shield, grasp the shield at the back and pull out to release the tabs at the back. 4. Rotate the shield down and then forward to release the tabs at the front of the shield. 5. After replacing the appliance bulb with one of the same or lower wattage, replace the shield. 6. Plug the refrigerator back in. We hope this information helps!

How to reset the temperature on my GE refrigerator model GFSS2HCYCSS
For model number GFSS2HCYCSS
Hi Sam, thank you for reaching out. Try resetting the control panel by turning off power to the refrigerator briefly. Unplug the refrigerator or turn it off at the circuit breaker for 30 seconds to reset the control. To adjust the freezer and refrigerator temperature, simply press the freezer/refrigerator cooler or warmer key multiple times. The normal setting should be 0 in the freezer and 38 in the refrigerator section. Glad to be of help!

The freezer in my side-by-side kept warming up -- often 20 degrees or more, which of course caused the fresh food side to warm up also. I do a lot of jump-in-with-both-feet home repairs, but never on a large appliance. Not having an ohmmeter, which cost about $100 for a reliable one, I took the symptoms to the internet.

How do I remove the plastic light casing to replace my refrigerator light?
For model number GFSS2HCYCSS
Hi Kandis, thank you for reaching out. You need to follow the following instructions to replace the light in the refrigerator: 1. Unplug the power to the appliance. 2. Open the refrigerator door to locate the light shield. 3. To remove the light shield, grasp the shield at the back and pull out to release the tabs at the back. 4. Rotate the shield down and then forward to release the tabs at the front of the shield. 5. After replacing the appliance bulb with one of the same or lower wattage, replace the shield. 6. Plug the refrigerator back in. We hope this information helps!

The refrigerator &amp; Freezer are working O.K. temps are good. The condenser fan motor doesn,t stop running. Compressor goes on &amp; off as normal.. What controls the condenser fan? Is there a thermistor ? Do i need a new circuit bd ?
For model number GFSS2HCYCSS
Hi Pete, thank you for your inquiry. Based on our research, the control board controls the condenser fan. We would suggest replacing the control board, part number PS2371164, to fix the issue. Glad to be of help!

How to reset the temperature on my GE refrigerator model GFSS2HCYCSS
For model number GFSS2HCYCSS
Hi Sam, thank you for reaching out. Try resetting the control panel by turning off power to the refrigerator briefly. Unplug the refrigerator or turn it off at the circuit breaker for 30 seconds to reset the control. To adjust the freezer and refrigerator temperature, simply press the freezer/refrigerator cooler or warmer key multiple times. The normal setting should be 0 in the freezer and 38 in the refrigerator section. Glad to be of help!

Ice forming on rear interior of freezer cabinet, then melts on to floor. Help!
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hello Laurence, thank you for the question. This could be caused by a dislodged Water Supply Tube to the Ice Maker creating a spill over and leaking. If the Tube is good, check the Ice maker Tray for cracks or damage that may cause a leak. If they check out good, watch the Ice maker during the fill cycle to see if it is over filling and spilling over. If so, the Water Valve may need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

It makes ice OK, but it won't dispense water. I replaced the main solenoid valve unit and replaced the filter. I'm sure I have the hoses in the right place. I would appreciate any help with this issue. Thank you. Charles R.
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hello Charles, thank you for writing. We suggest to check to see if the water pressure is at the correct psi. Also, there is a microswitch PS12724042 located in the dispenser module that could be the issue. Good luck with this repair.

Leaking at bottom of both sides
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hi Ramone, thank you for reaching out. We would suggest checking the drain line and the evaporator coils for frost build-up. A faulty defrost heater, part number PS2581596, may cause these components to get blocked due to excess ice buildup, which may eventually cause water leakage when the ice melts. The leaking water may come out of both sides and pool on the floor. We hope this information helps!

Ice forming on rear interior of freezer cabinet, then melts on to floor. Help!
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hello Laurence, thank you for the question. This could be caused by a dislodged Water Supply Tube to the Ice Maker creating a spill over and leaking. If the Tube is good, check the Ice maker Tray for cracks or damage that may cause a leak. If they check out good, watch the Ice maker during the fill cycle to see if it is over filling and spilling over. If so, the Water Valve may need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

The temperature selection controls for the refrigerator keep beeping several times and then going to 1. What could it be?
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hello Carl, thank you for the question. The issue you mentioned is due to faulty electronic control board, part number PS10060580. We would recommend checking the control board to fix this issue. Glad to be of help!

It makes ice OK, but it won't dispense water. I replaced the main solenoid valve unit and replaced the filter. I'm sure I have the hoses in the right place. I would appreciate any help with this issue. Thank you. Charles R.
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hello Charles, thank you for writing. We suggest to check to see if the water pressure is at the correct psi. Also, there is a microswitch PS12724042 located in the dispenser module that could be the issue. Good luck with this repair.

Leaking at bottom of both sides
For model number FFHS2611PFEA
Hi Ramone, thank you for reaching out. We would suggest checking the drain line and the evaporator coils for frost build-up. A faulty defrost heater, part number PS2581596, may cause these components to get blocked due to excess ice buildup, which may eventually cause water leakage when the ice melts. The leaking water may come out of both sides and pool on the floor. We hope this information helps!

water leaking out of refrigerator
In my specific appliance the water valve is located in the bottom right hand corner looking at it from the back. To get to it I remove the thin layer of cardboard the covers the back of the fridge. I then proceeded to disconnect the 1/4"" copper tubing which is the water feed coming out of the wall. Then I removed the screws that hold the ... Read more

Hello JERRICK and thanks for writing. If you already replaced the board and the fridge is again not working it might also be a faulty capacitor # PS11764031. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.

the fridge started making a clicking sound and the next day stopped working.lights are on but fridge and freezer are both warm
For model number PFS22SISBSS
Hi Thomas, Thank you for your question. If the compressor overheats, you may hear a clicking sound coming from it. This happens when the condenser fan motor stops working. The condenser fan motor forces air through the condenser coils to create a cooling effect. If it has stopped working, it will need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

Everything appears to be working, except recently ice cream in fridge is very soft after defrost cycle. The freezer temp is set to zero and frig is set to 37 and the readouts show these temps. The refrigerator seems to be running constantly and never shutting off. When I go to turbo boost it doesn’t sound any different. An6 suggestions?

Keep searches simple. Use keywords, e.g. ""leaking"", ""pump"", ""broken"" or ""fit"".
The refrigerator made continous ""whooing"" sounds that increased and decreased in pitch. Sounded like a ghost. Would keep us up at night. Also noticed that the heater was not heating under the evaporator coils.
After checking the stories, the consensus of opinion was to change the mother board. I had a tremendous help from Tom Paone at quality@applianceeducator.com. He also told me to change the motherboard but to make sure that the coils were totally defrosted before starting up the refrigerator after changing the board.

Fridge does not work,i am told that the board is defective. Had the board replaced and the fridge worked for a short while and stop.
For model number PFS22SISBSS
Hello JERRICK and thanks for writing. If you already replaced the board and the fridge is again not working it might also be a faulty capacitor # PS11764031. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.

the fridge started making a clicking sound and the next day stopped working.lights are on but fridge and freezer are both warm
For model number PFS22SISBSS
Hi Thomas, Thank you for your question. If the compressor overheats, you may hear a clicking sound coming from it. This happens when the condenser fan motor stops working. The condenser fan motor forces air through the condenser coils to create a cooling effect. If it has stopped working, it will need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

Everything appears to be working, except recently ice cream in fridge is very soft after defrost cycle. The freezer temp is set to zero and frig is set to 37 and the readouts show these temps. The refrigerator seems to be running constantly and never shutting off. When I go to turbo boost it doesn’t sound any different. An6 suggestions?
For model number PFS22SISBSS
Hi Bill, Thank you for writing. We suggest testing the Temperature Sensor and the Run Capacitor with a multi meter to check for continuity. We hope this helps!

Installation Instructions of parts on the PFS22SISBSS
[Viewing 3 of 499]
Keep searches simple. Use keywords, e.g. ""leaking"", ""pump"", ""broken"" or ""fit"".
The refrigerator made continous ""whooing"" sounds that increased and decreased in pitch. Sounded like a ghost. Would keep us up at night. Also noticed that the heater was not heating under the evaporator coils.
After checking the stories, the consensus of opinion was to change the mother board. I had a tremendous help from Tom Paone at quality@applianceeducator.com. He also told me to change the motherboard but to make sure that the coils were totally defrosted before starting up the refrigerator after changing the board.

Hello, My fridge is not producing ice, the water is not coming out as well. what should i do? thank you, ravis
For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hi Ravis, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue. Good luck with your repair.

I am looking for a defrost timer for my GE refrigrator model GSH25JSTASS. The unit is working fine, everything is normal; except that it seems to run all the time. I alrady put a new thermostat. Thank you, Geoffrey
For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hello Geoffrey, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, there is no defrost timer in your model; only defrost thermostat is responsible for defrosting. You can check your condenser fan, part number PS1483567, as a faulty fan motor can cause the compressor to run all the time. Dirty condenser coils can also cause the compressor to run all the time, which will need to be cleaned to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!

For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hi Richard, thank you for reaching out. As you have already replaced all the necessary parts, and replaced the defrost thermostat as well, we would suggest checking the temperature sensor of the freezer section. Its part number is PS304103. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this sorts out your problem!

Hello, My fridge is not producing ice, the water is not coming out as well. what should i do? thank you, ravis
For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hi Ravis, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue. Good luck with your repair.

I am looking for a defrost timer for my GE refrigrator model GSH25JSTASS. The unit is working fine, everything is normal; except that it seems to run all the time. I alrady put a new thermostat. Thank you, Geoffrey
For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hello Geoffrey, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, there is no defrost timer in your model; only defrost thermostat is responsible for defrosting. You can check your condenser fan, part number PS1483567, as a faulty fan motor can cause the compressor to run all the time. Dirty condenser coils can also cause the compressor to run all the time, which will need to be cleaned to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!

WHEN IT GOES INTO DEFROST, THE TEMPERATURE IN THE FREEZER RISES TO 60 DEGREES, WHICH CAUSES EVERYTHING TO START TO DEFROST. IVE REPLACED THE HEATER, THE HIGH LIMIT COUPLER, AND THERMISTOR ON THE EVAPORATOR AS WELL AS A NEW MAIN CONTROL BOARD. ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.. THANK TOU
For model number GSH25JSTASS
Hi Richard, thank you for reaching out. As you have already replaced all the necessary parts, and replaced the defrost thermostat as well, we would suggest checking the temperature sensor of the freezer section. Its part number is PS304103. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this sorts out your problem!

Jim
March 17, 2020
The outside of the wall between the fridge and the freezer seems very hot. I'm talking about the area where the doors close to. I checked it with my infrared thermometer, it is 147 degrees. The fridge and the freezer seem to be working fine, it keeps things at the proper. Is this normal?Thanks
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Jim, thank you for your question. It is normal for this part to be quite warm, but it should not be as hot as you are describing. The condenser fan motor, PartSelect number PS1957416, is more than likely causing this issue. You will want to check this motor to be sure it is running as it should. If there is debris blocking the fan blades from circulating the air over the condenser coils, this symptom may arise. If there is nothing blocking the fan blades, and the motor is not working as it should, it is recommended that this part be replaced. We hope this helps.

My refrigerator runs for several hours then turns off and beeps and the lights flash, has anyone had that problem? What could it be?
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Danny, Thank you for contacting us. Researching your model, this usually indicates an issue with the control board or the wiring. We would recommend checking the main control board and inverter board for the compressor. Good luck with your repair.

Lost freezer and cooler temperature
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Frank, Thank you for the question. If the Temperature inside the Freezer is too warm, we suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat. The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps

The outside of the wall between the fridge and the freezer seems very hot. I'm talking about the area where the doors close to. I checked it with my infrared thermometer, it is 147 degrees. The fridge and the freezer seem to be working fine, it keeps things at the proper. Is this normal?Thanks
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Jim, thank you for your question. It is normal for this part to be quite warm, but it should not be as hot as you are describing. The condenser fan motor, PartSelect number PS1957416, is more than likely causing this issue. You will want to check this motor to be sure it is running as it should. If there is debris blocking the fan blades from circulating the air over the condenser coils, this symptom may arise. If there is nothing blocking the fan blades, and the motor is not working as it should, it is recommended that this part be replaced. We hope this helps.

My refrigerator runs for several hours then turns off and beeps and the lights flash, has anyone had that problem? What could it be?
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Danny, Thank you for contacting us. Researching your model, this usually indicates an issue with the control board or the wiring. We would recommend checking the main control board and inverter board for the compressor. Good luck with your repair.

Lost freezer and cooler temperature
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hello Frank, Thank you for the question. If the Temperature inside the Freezer is too warm, we suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat. The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps

Light bulb quit working and tried new e17 bulb from 3 different sources. The good bulb on the other side worked in the socket with the bad bulb, so socket seems ok.
For model number KSCS25INSS00
Hi Michael, thank you for your question. If your light is still not working then you may have to take a look at the socket, wiring, and light switch for being the issue. Good luck with your repair.

What part do I need fridge went warm can still motor running
For model number GTH18GBDCRWW
Hello Richard, thank you for getting in touch. Based on our research, we would recommend checking the fresh food section door gasket for any damage. If the gasket is fine, then the issue is most probably with air diffuser, part number PS963570. It channels and controls the cold airflow from the freezer compartment into the refrigerator compartment. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. Glad to be of help!

When the refrigerator is running there is a loud whirring noise coming from the freezer. The freezer control has to be turned all the up to keep refrigerator cold. Thank you.

What part do I need fridge went warm can still motor running
For model number GTH18GBDCRWW
Hello Richard, thank you for getting in touch. Based on our research, we would recommend checking the fresh food section door gasket for any damage. If the gasket is fine, then the issue is most probably with air diffuser, part number PS963570. It channels and controls the cold airflow from the freezer compartment into the refrigerator compartment. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. Glad to be of help!

The refrigerator made continous ""whooing"" sounds that increased and decreased in pitch. Sounded like a ghost. Would keep us up at night. Also noticed that the heater was not heating under the evaporator coils.
After checking the stories, the consensus of opinion was to change the mother board. I had a tremendous help from Tom Paone at quality@applianceeducator.com. He also told me to change the motherboard but to make sure that the coils were totally defrosted before starting up the refrigerator after changing the board.

The refrigerator made continous ""whooing"" sounds that increased and decreased in pitch. Sounded like a ghost. Would keep us up at night. Also noticed that the heater was not heating under the evaporator coils.
After checking the stories, the consensus of opinion was to change the mother board. I had a tremendous help from Tom Paone at quality@applianceeducator.com. He also told me to change the motherboard but to make sure that the coils were totally defrosted before starting up the refrigerator after changing the board.

Where is the refrigerator thermistor located?
For model number LFX28968ST
Hello and thank you for writing. The fresh food thermistor is located behind a cover at the top of the fresh food section. The roof would need to be dissembled to get to the thermistor. It is usually located near the light assembly. We hope this information helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

Remove and replace light switch
Video makes it look easy. Kenmore refrigerator does not have ""groove"" along the right hand side of switch that allows for pushing down on release. Used a thin screwdriver to get under to push while holding switch edge with pliers. Kept slipping. Tape sides to avoid scratching inside of refrigerator.

Where is the refrigerator thermistor located?
For model number LFX28968ST
Hello and thank you for writing. The fresh food thermistor is located behind a cover at the top of the fresh food section. The roof would need to be dissembled to get to the thermistor. It is usually located near the light assembly. We hope this information helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

Remove and replace light switch
Video makes it look easy. Kenmore refrigerator does not have ""groove"" along the right hand side of switch that allows for pushing down on release. Used a thin screwdriver to get under to push while holding switch edge with pliers. Kept slipping. Tape sides to avoid scratching inside of refrigerator.

My nephew accidentally forced the door closed last year, which resulted in the door having to be re closed manually folding back the flap. Ugh!
Unscered 2 screws, unplug electrical connection under the screws, slide her flap into grooves, realign screw holes , and rescrew in. Done.

So easy I couldn't believe I'd done it so quickly. Two minutes from start to finish. Pull the old one off and press the new one in.
