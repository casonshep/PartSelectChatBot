Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Dishwasher Rack Track Stop
★★★★★
★★★★★
140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
151 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11756150
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10546503
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as ""easy"" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

Dishwasher Dish Rack Adjuster Kit - Left and Right Side
★★★★★
★★★★★
1081 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10064063
Manufacturer Part Number W10712394
This rack adjuster kit (Dishrack Adjuster Kit, Adjuster Kit, Dishwasher Rack Adjuster) will adjust the height of the upper rack of your dishwasher. It connects to the dishrack. The kit is constructed of grey plastic and metal, and measures approximately 12 inches wide and 6.5 inches tall. The rack adjuster can break from material fatigue or prolonged high temperature exposure. High temperature exposure can compromise the integrity of the materials. If the rack adjuster breaks, your upper rack may fall down, may be unlevel, or the door may not close. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)

Replacement was pretty easy after figuring out how to unsnap/unlock the old pieces. Tools only used to do a little prying and poking, but really aren't needed. Everything either snaps or slides together. Piece of cake

Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★
★★★★★
90 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

The tine pivot clip, also known as the tine row pivot, is used in dishwashers and is located in the upper dishrack. At around 3 inches in length, the clip is used to keep the tine row in place in the dishrack. If your clip is cracked or damaged, it is best to replace this part.

Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution. This repair was rated as very easy by our customers and should be done in 15 minutes or less.

Dish rack tracks failed over time
The repair was easy. You will need to make sure any screws securing the dishwasher are removed at the top front of the dishwasher under the counter and above the top of the dishwasher. Then pull the dishwasher out exposing roughly 18"" of each side of the dishwasher then use a socket to remove the screws holding the tracks in place, 4 in total on each side. Then install new tracks and slide dishwasher back into place and secure.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
151 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11756150
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10546503
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as ""easy"" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!!

Dishwasher Dish Rack Adjuster Kit - Left and Right Side
★★★★★
★★★★★
1081 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10064063
Manufacturer Part Number W10712394
This rack adjuster kit (Dishrack Adjuster Kit, Adjuster Kit, Dishwasher Rack Adjuster) will adjust the height of the upper rack of your dishwasher. It connects to the dishrack. The kit is constructed of grey plastic and metal, and measures approximately 12 inches wide and 6.5 inches tall. The rack adjuster can break from material fatigue or prolonged high temperature exposure. High temperature exposure can compromise the integrity of the materials. If the rack adjuster breaks, your upper rack may fall down, may be unlevel, or the door may not close. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)

Replace rack adjusters - wheel were broken
Replacement was pretty easy after figuring out how to unsnap/unlock the old pieces. Tools only used to do a little prying and poking, but really aren't needed. Everything either snaps or slides together. Piece of cake

Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★

90 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

The repair was easy. You will need to make sure any screws securing the dishwasher are removed at the top front of the dishwasher under the counter and above the top of the dishwasher. Then pull the dishwasher out exposing roughly 18"" of each side of the dishwasher then use a socket to remove the screws holding the tracks in place, 4 in total on each side. Then install new tracks and slide dishwasher back into place and secure.

The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in. Make sure the dishwasher is off before starting this installation project.

The plastic clip on the roller broke
We let this go for a shameful amount of time before I decided I could probably fix it. The roller broke so you could only pull it out about halfway or it would come off the track. I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

This part is the replacement carrier roller for your dishwasher. It is also known as the wheel support. It is made of gray plastic and is approximately 5 inches by 2 inches. The carrier roller supports the wheels on your upper dish rack so it can slide in and out of the dishwasher efficiently. This roller is for the right side of the dish rack, the left side is sold separately. Because it is made of plastic, the roller can occasionally crack and break, and when this occurs, it will need to be replaced. If you notice that your dish rack is having difficulty sliding in and out, you should check to see if the roller is damaged. This is an OEM part from the manufacturer and it is sold individually.

Lower rack wheel was melted
Unsnapped clip,and moved it 90 degrees. Slip wheel and clip off. Installed clip on new wheel. replaced new wheel. The wheel did not come with a new clip and was not suggested on the parts list. The existing clip was still OK but if it was not, I would have had to order a clip and wait. All in all, a good experience.

The plastic clip on the roller broke
We let this go for a shameful amount of time before I decided I could probably fix it. The roller broke so you could only pull it out about halfway or it would come off the track. I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in. Make sure the dishwasher is off before starting this installation project.

Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★

206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Scott from Flowood, MS
Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Mohammad from WOODBRIDGE, VA
Water was leaking from the bottom of the door during wash cycle
I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

Door leaking from corner.
First, I replaced the bottom door seal. You will need magnetic nut drivers because of the location of the 3/16 screws that hold the seal in place. you also need a 1/4 in nut driver to remove plastic cover that covers up the 5 3/16 screws. Last you need a small star driver to remove the door screws. Note 4 of the door screws, the 4 on top of the door are much longer than the side screws. With all this said, this seal was not my problem. I then replaced the large black rubber seal around the tub. Be sure if you do this you fold the seal in half and start in the middle of the top of the opening so you have the exact amount of seal left over on both sides. Also when you remove the old seal, clean the area it was removed from with a damp cloth. Turns out, That was not my problem either. So now I will move to the next step to see where the water is coming from but maybe this information will help someone with a simple door leak.

This door gasket is a genuine OEM replacement part that is specially designed for your dishwasher. The gasket is located around the frame of the dishwasher. It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.

Replaced old gasket with new one. More difficult than expected, because new gasket was much stiffer than old one.

Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket

206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Gasket at the bottom of the door disintegrated.
Took off the kickplate, diconnected the wires and removed the whole door by lifting straight up, removing spring wires from hinges. Once door is disconnected from the machine, removed one hinge by removing bolt. Slid gasket into place, secured hinge back in place, then reconnected wires at bottom, replaced hinge spring wires and slid door back down onto hinges. Now that we know how to do it, could do it in 15 min to half hour.

The tub gasket, also known as the door gasket runs along the perimeter of your dishwasher basin and creates a seal that prevents water from leaking out when the tub is full. If you notice water on the floor after you run your dishwasher, it may be an indication that the gasket is loose or damaged. If your door gasket is damaged, it will need to be replaced.

Water was leaking from the bottom of the door during wash cycle
I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

Door leaking from corner.
First, I replaced the bottom door seal. You will need magnetic nut drivers because of the location of the 3/16 screws that hold the seal in place. you also need a 1/4 in nut driver to remove plastic cover that covers up the 5 3/16 screws. Last you need a small star driver to remove the door screws. Note 4 of the door screws, the 4 on top of the door are much longer than the side screws. With all this said, this seal was not my problem. I then replaced the large black rubber seal around the tub. Be sure if you do this you fold the seal in half and start in the middle of the top of the opening so you have the exact amount of seal left over on both sides. Also when you remove the old seal, clean the area it was removed from with a damp cloth. Turns out, That was not my problem either. So now I will move to the next step to see where the water is coming from but maybe this information will help someone with a simple door leak.

Replaced old gasket with new one. More difficult than expected, because new gasket was much stiffer than old one. Also, the yellow centering spot on gasket (to line up with top latch) was nearly impossible to see. Unfortunately, this did not solve the problem for me, so money was wasted. Bought new dishwasher.

Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle.

Spray arm had become unattached and burned by the heat element
It was a simple as: attach and done!
There is a ring on the part that tightens clockwise to the nipple that sprays out the water that it rests on. Twist clockwise and you are done!
It is a mystery how it was unattached to begin with but not a problem in the end, it was easy to fix!

Thanks for sending genuine GE parts!

PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

Lower spray arm was not turing properly and causing poor wash results
I noticed the upper bushing washer was worn thin. this caused the lower spray arm to rise too high and wobble during all the wash cycles. Also the rotation of the lower spray arm was wearing grooves in the lower bushing.

I removed the retaining nut and simply replaced teh defective parts. While I was at it I figured equal wear might be evident on the upper spray arm so I bought a complete rebuild kit to bring all rotational parts back to new and equal preformance that was achieved by removing the ss screw and removing the upper spray arm, bushing and clip then replacing them in the order of removal. Noticed a huge difference in the quality of the washed dishes!! Thanks Parts Select 100% to yoru company!!

Mid Spray Arm Assembly not spinning
The Mid Spray Arm Assembly was not spinning due to a dish that was in placed the dishwasher that was too high and hitting the arm. When it spun until it broke the center shaft. Replacement was easy. After removing power I pulled the upper tray out and removed the Conduit Mid Tiered Assembly by unsnapping it from the tray. I twisted off the broken spindle of the damaged arm assembly from the Conduit Mid Tiered Assembly and inserted the new arm and gently pushed it until it snapped into the Mid Tiered Assembly. Reinstalled the assembled parts by snapping into the tray making sure it was centered.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

The original lower spray arm has a blue circle sprayer that must have worn out and dislodged itself from the sprayer arm, it landed on the heating element and melted a bit!
We easily removed the original sprayer arm, and clicked the new sprayer arm right into place. I know *very little* about appliances/repairs, etc but this was so easy and an affordable repair for our dishwasher.

The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

This middle spray arm kit includes an upper spray arm, a holder or hanger, water supply tube or delivery tube, split ring seal, and a screw. The function of these parts is to spray water to all levels of the dishwasher so the dishes will come out completely clean. This kit has recently been redesigned. It does not include the upper support or mount, so consider ordering those parts as well if necessary. The spray arm is approximately 18 inches long, and all parts are white in colour.

Lower spray arm was not turing properly and causing poor wash results
I noticed the upper bushing washer was worn thin. this caused the lower spray arm to rise too high and wobble during all the wash cycles. Also the rotation of the lower spray arm was wearing grooves in the lower bushing.

I removed the retaining nut and simply replaced teh defective parts. While I was at it I figured equal wear might be evident on the upper spray arm so I bought a complete rebuild kit to bring all rotational parts back to new and equal preformance that was achieved by removing the ss screw and removing the upper spray arm, bushing and clip then replacing them in the order of removal. Noticed a huge difference in the quality of the washed dishes!! Thanks Parts Select 100% to yoru company!!

Dishwasher MID SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
12 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137080
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33498
This OEM mid spray or center wash arm assembly distributes water and detergent in your dishwasher during the wash cycle. It has small nozzles that spray water onto your dishes and is located between the lower and upper rack. A broken assembly will result in weak water flow and ineffective dishwashing. It may also display signs of damage such as cracks, breaks, or missing nozzles. Additionally, a malfunctioning assembly can cause imbalanced water flow, potentially leading to damage to other dishwasher components such as filters or pumps. Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage. To install this to your appliance, you will need to snap its mounting bracket onto the rack before attaching the arms onto it. This replacement part is sold individually.

Mid Spray Arm Assembly not spinning
The Mid Spray Arm Assembly was not spinning due to a dish that was in placed the dishwasher that was too high and hitting the arm. When it spun until it broke the center shaft. Replacement was easy. After removing power I pulled the upper tray out and removed the Conduit Mid Tiered Assembly by unsnapping it from the tray. I twisted off the broken spindle of the damaged arm assembly from the Conduit Mid Tiered Assembly and inserted the new arm and gently pushed it until it snapped into the Mid Tiered Assembly. Reinstalled the assembled parts by snapping into the tray making sure it was centered.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

The original lower spray arm has a blue circle sprayer that must have worn out and dislodged itself from the sprayer arm, it landed on the heating element and melted a bit!
We easily removed the original sprayer arm, and clicked the new sprayer arm right into place. I know *very little* about appliances/repairs, etc but this was so easy and an affordable repair for our dishwasher.

Water washing out under front door onto floor
The plastic parts on this spray arm assembly wear with time and the rotation wobble effect creates a wave action in the pool of water at the bottom of the dishwasher. This waves the water onto the front door and forces a leak outside the unit. Replace the lower arm assembly, washer, bearing and nut. They all wear. Also remember to tighten the screws on top of the pump assembly. They loosen and aid in the wobble. Good Luck!

Water leaking under the dishwasher
I looked under and found that 2 brass nuts that secured the heater element through the base housing of the dishwasher has split down each side of the nut and no longer was tight enough to keep water from leaking around either end of the heater element. I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element. I removed the two nuts and replaced them with the parts I ordered from partselect.com. I then put the appropriate wires back at the end of the heater element and ran the dishwasher to check for leaks. No leaks... it was fixed.

Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

The brass nut measures 7 inches in length x 1 inch in width x 5 inches in height, and fits most dishwashers. To see if this part is compatible with your dishwasher, check the list of compatible brands below.

Dennis from Tryon, NC
Water leaking under the dishwasher
I looked under and found that 2 brass nuts that secured the heater element through the base housing of the dishwasher has split down each side of the nut and no longer was tight enough to keep water from leaking around either end of the heater element. I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element. I removed the two nuts and replaced them with the parts I ordered from partselect.com. I then put the appropriate wires back at the end of the heater element and ran the dishwasher to check for leaks. No leaks... it was fixed.

A plastic retainer pin for the bottom kick panel was missing.
simply line up the new pin with the rectangular slot in the kick panel and metal panel behind, slide the pin in and turn it with a flat blade screw driver.
NOTE: the original pin was black. A black replacement part cost $29 plus shipping! A knock-off pin was only $6 plus shipping. I got the cheap one and colored it with a black Sharpee marker before installation.

Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

Dishwasher Circulation Pump
★★★★★
★★★★★
7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes
The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Pump would not drain tub
Repair went fine, getting the right pump was the problem. I started with my local appliance parts house, they ordered part came in 3 days. Upon picking it up I noticed that the pump was shaped slightly different and the electrical hook up was totally different. Asking the parts guy what happened he said they must have sent the wrong pump. Returned it for credit and ordered it again. Four days later the same exact thing occurs. Parts guy credits my account and says better go directly to GE. Wait 10 days for GE, for this part and once again same odd looking pump with wrong electrical plug. My son who is a welder by trade asks me if there is a packet of parts in carton and yes there is. He says that perhaps there is a converter for the electrical. That was the solution no one told us that pump was universal and needed the adapter. Not even the 2 different tecks at first house. Perhaps that should be stated in the part would have saved us tons of time. Thanks D

Dishwasher ran but didn't wash
I got lucky and found the diagnostic test instructions tucked inside the washer under the kick plate. From there I ran the tests on each component until I narrowed it down to the pump. The pump cost me less than local dealers. The install went well. Watched the online videos to make sure I was doing it right. Was actually very easy and saved hundreds over a service call.

The washer had an error message in the display of E:09. I called Bosh on customer srevice and she said that the heat pump was not working and needed to be replaced. Since the motor is the main part for this that needed to be replaced as well. The pars were under $200.00 total so we oted to fix this
We followed the video and had no problems with leaks at all afterwards. The parts fit perfectly and the machine is working great again.

Dishwasher ran but didn't wash
I got lucky and found the diagnostic test instructions tucked inside the washer under the kick plate. From there I ran the tests on each component until I narrowed it down to the pump. The pump cost me less than local dealers. The install went well. Watched the online videos to make sure I was doing it right. Was actually very easy and saved hundreds over a service call.

Dishwasher Circulation Pump
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

Samoil from COOPER CITY, FL
The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes
The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

This is a drain pump kit for dishwashers. The drain pump for is responsible for pulling out and removing all contaminated food water from your dishwasher during and at the end of its washing cycle.

This drain pump kit comes with the drain itself, as well as 5 different metal screw clamps of varying sizes. Replacing this drain pump will require some disassembly of your dishwasher, which means you will need a screwdriver, wrench, and protective equipment such as work gloves. This drain pump is sold as an individual OEM part, and does not come with any hoses or wire harnesses, so consider that before ordering.

Dishwasher was not draining.
I listened to the DW cycles to be sure it was the drain pump (no water passes through discharge tube). We already had checked inside filter and our drain line. I watched video and saw it was a simple change. We unplugged and removed the pump and the new one fit exactly-it came with several clamps. Very simple & effective!

Pump would not drain tub
Repair went fine, getting the right pump was the problem. I started with my local appliance parts house, they ordered part came in 3 days. Upon picking it up I noticed that the pump was shaped slightly different and the electrical hook up was totally different. Asking the parts guy what happened he said they must have sent the wrong pump. Returned it for credit and ordered it again. Four days later the same exact thing occurs. Parts guy credits my account and says better go directly to GE. Wait 10 days for GE, for this part and once again same odd looking pump with wrong electrical plug. My son who is a welder by trade asks me if there is a packet of parts in carton and yes there is. He says that perhaps there is a converter for the electrical. That was the solution no one told us that pump was universal and needed the adapter. Not even the 2 different tecks at first house. Perhaps that should be stated in the part would have saved us tons of time. Thanks D

132 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS334230
Manufacturer Part Number 279570
This part replaces your appliances latch (Door Latch Kit, Door Catch, Dryer Door Latch Kit). On your appliance you will find both a strike and a catch. The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.

Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Door latch not functioning
1. Turn off breaker supplying power to dishwasher in electrical panel
2. Open dishwasher door
3. Unscrew the screws that secure the dishwasher to the counter.
4. Tip dishwasher forward. Identify the non-functioning door latch. It looks exactly like the replacement. Unclip the wire harness from the door latch.
5. On the inside of the dishwasher, there are 2 screws directly under the door latch. Unscrew them and carefully set aside.
6. Remove old door latch.
7. Set new door latch in place. Holding securely, replace screws removed in step 5. Toward the end they get a little tougher to screw in.
8. Plug wire harness into new door latch.
9. Re-align dishwasher and re-secure to counter in previous position.
10. Test latch to make sure it closes properly.
11. Turn on breaker in electrical panel.
The dishwasher should now function properly.

This replacement part is a door latch assembly for a dishwasher. The latch keeps the appliance door closed while it is running, and prohibits the dishwasher from starting when the door is open. Depending on your model, you will need to remove approximately eleven screws to remove the inner panel and access the latch assembly. The latch assembly is connected by two wiring harnesses that are nearly identical, so it is recommended to make note of where each harness goes before continuing with the repair. You will need a Torx screwdriver to complete the repair. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source before beginning this repair.

Turned off power to dishwasher, my electrical panel is clearly marked with switch for dishwasher. No guess work there.
3 min. to remove old assy. 3 min. to replace with new part.
I might add that I am a 67yr. old female. So if I can handle this repair, anyone can.

Appliance read out ""err"", would not go on
It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch. Looked on line and found the mail switch to go on was in the latch. I took it apart, 6 screws, wiggled the switch and it went on. So I found the door switch to be bad. It was very simple to change the switch.

Dishwasher Door Catch Kit
★★★★★

132 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS334230
Manufacturer Part Number 279570
This part replaces your appliances latch (Door Latch Kit, Door Catch, Dryer Door Latch Kit). On your appliance you will find both a strike and a catch. The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.

Door Catch part had fallen out,/ was missing
Received your parts, Popped them both right into place, Even though only one side needed to be replaced, I wanted them to match up. It was amazing how easy this was. My husband was quite impressed I had ordered these rather then look for either a new or used dryer from some other source.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

PartSelect Number PS6447681
Manufacturer Part Number WD21X10490
This is replacement door latch for your dishwasher. The door latch is attached to the tub frame, and connects to the door strike to keep your dishwasher door closed during operation. If you have a broken or faulty door latch, your dishwasher door may not stay closed, and this can prevent the dishwasher from running. This item is sold individually, and if your door strike is also damaged, you will need to replace that part separately. This is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
James from ALBRIGHTSVLLE, PA
Door latch not functioning
1. Turn off breaker supplying power to dishwasher in electrical panel
2. Open dishwasher door
3. Unscrew the screws that secure the dishwasher to the counter.
4. Tip dishwasher forward. Identify the non-functioning door latch. It looks exactly like the replacement. Unclip the wire harness from the door latch.
5. On the inside of the dishwasher, there are 2 screws directly under the door latch. Unscrew them and carefully set aside.
6. Remove old door latch.
7. Set new door latch in place. Holding securely, replace screws removed in step 5. Toward the end they get a little tougher to screw in.
8. Plug wire harness into new door latch.
9. Re-align dishwasher and re-secure to counter in previous position.
10. Test latch to make sure it closes properly.
11. Turn on breaker in electrical panel.
The dishwasher should now function properly.

Door would not latch shut
Following a utube video made it easy. Removed the outer cover of the door to expose latch. Two screws remove the latch, pay attention to how it was positioned and put the new one on and then replace the panel. But first turn off the electricity to the unit at the fuse box.

135 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731673
Manufacturer Part Number W10862259
This replacement part is a door latch assembly for a dishwasher. The latch keeps the appliance door closed while it is running, and prohibits the dishwasher from starting when the door is open. Depending on your model, you will need to remove approximately eleven screws to remove the inner panel and access the latch assembly. The latch assembly is connected by two wiring harnesses that are nearly identical, so it is recommended to make note of where each harness goes before continuing with the repair. You will need a Torx screwdriver to complete the repair. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source before beginning this repair.

Handle and latch broke
I had to force the door open, due to a broken handle/latch.
Ordered assembly with help of order desk to assure correct part number. Arrived within 3 to 4 days. Not sure but very fast. Only had to wash dishes by hand once.
Turned off power to dishwasher, my electrical panel is clearly marked with switch for dishwasher. No guess work there.
3 min. to remove old assy. 3 min. to replace with new part.
I might add that I am a 67yr. old female. So if I can handle this repair, anyone can.

This dishwasher latch strike is a manufacturer-approved replacement part for your appliance. The latch strike is an important component in your dishwasher door assembly, and adds an extra layer of security in keeping the door closed.

Doesn't complete dry cycle, no clean light, random noises as if door was closing
Removed toe kick. Removed door counter weights and placed door on soft surface. Removed two bolts(I was able to leave hinges in place) slid door panel down and off. Removed plastic snap fit cover and 4 bolts from UI board. Two of the stand-offs where broken, glued them back into place. Ensured jumpers were set to my model, snapped cover back in place and remounted door. The dishwasher now runs through the cycle and clean light but did not dry. That turned out to be a bad flood switch.

This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom.

To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

The element heating assembly is found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, and helps to warm the water in the wash cycle, and dry the dishes afterward. If the water does not heat up during the wash cycle, or the dishes are not being dried properly, you may need to replace the element heating assembly in your dishwasher. This element heating assembly is horseshoe-shaped and is sold individually. To replace your heating assembly, first make sure it has cooled down, then simply slide the connecting tabs out. Replace with a new heating element and your problem should be solved.

Diswasher not drying dishes
Didn't actually do the compete repair but got close. Pulled out dishwasher, disconnected and checked continuity on the existing heating element (about 16 ohms) the new element was also about 16 ohms. This indicates they both were working fine and no need for replacement. Next step would have been to swap the elements would have been simple. Tried to replace main board as well, still not the issue so giving up and replacing the dishwasher. It wasn't the high temp cut off thermostat either incidentally and no error codes in maintenance mode. Check continuity of your existing element before ordering to save aggravation.

This heating element is a genuine OEM replacement sourced directly from the original manufacturer for use in various models of dishwashers. The element is designed to heat water inside the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles to enhance the efficiency of the cleaning process. It is positioned at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, beneath the lower rack. The heating element includes a bushing, which is a protective covering that prevents water from coming into contact with the electric terminals, and two plastic nuts.

Leaking Dishwasher
After pulling the dishwasher out, I was able to determine the leak was occurring around the plastic nuts on the end of the heating element. I removed the heating element and saw that even though there were washers on the ends that protruded through the backside of the machine, they really weren't sealing the holes the element was sticking through. Looking at YouTube videos on the installation procedure, I noticed the element being installed had a sort of metal grommet permanently affixed to each end and the rubber washers were between the grommet and the dishwasher body. I ordered the new part and saw this to be when I received the new part. This grommet allowed the washer to seal the hole, once the plastic nuts were installed on the backside of the dishwasher. This seems to have stopped the leak. I don't know how the original part ever worked correctly, since the washers freely sat on the element with nothing to force them up against the body of the dishwasher and seal the holes. It may have been leaking long before I discovered the problem.

leak at heater element
The tub perforations at the heater leaked and water dripped onto the fastening nuts and the electrical connections. I ordered a new heater element and it did not have the necessary nuts to fasten it to the tub. I had to go back and order them separately. The original nuts are very unique and cannot be substituted for.The manufacturer should send them with every heater element because this leaking problem is very prevalent on these machines.

Burning smell from dishwasher
So one day passing the dishwasher while it was running, I noticed a rather pungent burning smell. Yikes, I shut it off!
I took apart the pump housing at the bottom inside the dishwasher, expecting to find some kids toy plastic bit had got caught and had jammed the motor or something. But nothing there, and my dishwasher has a little screen to keep just such things from getting to the pump anyway. Hmmm.
So, ran the dishwasher again, seemed ok now.
A week later, same thing, burning smell. Pull it apart again, but no sign of trouble. But I know something is up, so I pull the kickplate and have a look underneath... Way at the back I see a red wire that looks a little melted, but it's hard to tell, so I pull the whole dishwasher out. Sure enough, one of the heater wires is melted and burned, and the plastic locknut holding that side of the heater is badly scorched. Looks like a little electrical fire, I'm lucky it didn't get out of hand!
The heater still tests ok with an ohmeter, but I don't trust it now - order the heater and replacement locknut and washers. Didn't need to order washers, they come with the heater, oh well.
Heater removal and replacement is very straight forward, but I added some high-temp gasket silicone sealant (Ultra Blue) around the seals as I think the original problem may have ben a bit of water leakage causing a short.
Took about an hour to pull the dishwasher out, remove the heater and install the new one, put a new terminal on the heater wire, and put the whole thing back under the counter.
Working great now. But not a problem I expected to have with a 2-year-old dishwasher!

This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

The element heating assembly is found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, and helps to warm the water in the wash cycle, and dry the dishes afterward. If the water does not heat up during the wash cycle, or the dishes are not being dried properly, you may need to replace the element heating assembly in your dishwasher. This element heating assembly is horseshoe-shaped and is sold individually. To replace your heating assembly, first make sure it has cooled down, then simply slide the connecting tabs out. Replace with a new heating element and your problem should be solved.

Diswasher not drying dishes
Didn't actually do the compete repair but got close. Pulled out dishwasher, disconnected and checked continuity on the existing heating element (about 16 ohms) the new element was also about 16 ohms. This indicates they both were working fine and no need for replacement. Next step would have been to swap the elements would have been simple. Tried to replace main board as well, still not the issue so giving up and replacing the dishwasher. It wasn't the high temp cut off thermostat either incidentally and no error codes in maintenance mode. Check continuity of your existing element before ordering to save aggravation.

This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

E:15 error code with Watertap
The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.

In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.

I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.

I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.

Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!

Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.

Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes. Not sure if needed or not.

Good luck!

This water inlet valve is usually located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner of the dishwasher. The attaching solenoids on the valve open and close according to the desired amount of water needed. The water inlet valve on your dishwasher supplies water to the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is leaking because it has overflowed, the water inlet valve may be the cause. If your dishwasher continues to fill above the heating element, try opening the door latch to see if it stops filling. If it continues to fill, you have a defective inlet valve that will need to be replaced.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Greg from Burlington, VT
Water leak, small puddle to front left of dishwasher
You'll need to remove the front toe kick and (if installed, the GE Profile baffling for additional silencing action).

You will need to disconnect the right wire connection to access the right screw (and may need to use a flat head screwdriver). You can then remove the 2 screws that hold the Valve Water Inlet on.

You will then need to loosen and the hose clamp that attaches the water line to the Valve Water Inlet. You may need to force it undone since the rubber connection is pretty secure around the water tube inlet.

Disconnect the plastic wire housing from the Valve Water Inlet and you should now have the Valve Water Inlet disconnected.

Reverse the order and reconnect everything and you should be good to go!

Double-check for any leaks prior to pushing everything back in :)

Dishwasher was not filling up at the start of the cycle.
This was really easy. Have done it before on other older dishwashers in the past.
Turned off the breaker for the dishwasher. Turned off the water supply valve. Unscrewed the screws in the panel that hides the parts under the dishwasher. Unscrewed the screws anchoring the dishwasher to the counter. Slid the dishwasher out about a foot. Inlet valve was located on the front left side of the dishwasher. Unclipped the wire harness. Placed a cookie sheet under the water line. Unscrewed the water line from the inlet valve. Unscrewed the two Phillips head screws holding the valve to the dishwasher frame. Got the new part. Put the screws back into the frame. Reconnected the water line and wire harness. Slid the washer back into place. Turned on the water valve. Watched for leaks. Turned the breaker back on and started the cycle. Watched for leaks. Once I saw there weren’t any replaced the screws anchoring it to the counter and replaced the cover on the bottom. That was it! Took me longer to type out the steps than it did to actually do the repair.

The valve allowed water to fill the dishwasher when not in use.
This was the third time I replaced a fill valve in a Bosch diswasher, twice in this unit and once in a previous unit. I read the installation hints on your web site and want to add the following suggestion.

The notes on your web site say you can remove the valve from behind the toe face and pull it out to reach the hose and plug. I found that the Bosch designers called for both the hose and wire to on the short side. I found that pulling the dishwasher forward 6"" to 9"" allows you to access these connections from the side at least to hold them while making the connection. I hope this helps. Thank you, Bill

Inlet valve leaking at water connection
The valve has a plastic fitting to attach the the water line with a hose fitting. Was not carful enough with the original and damaged it attaching the water line. Ordered a replacement fitting. While it is possible to replace the water inlet valve without pulling the dishwasher out from the cabinet found it was easier to get at with the machine out. The video does and good job of showing the removal and replacing the valve. Easy job, don't be like me and be careful attaching the water line.

Installation Instructions
Greg from Burlington, VT
Water leak, small puddle to front left of dishwasher
You'll need to remove the front toe kick and (if installed, the GE Profile baffling for additional silencing action).

You will need to disconnect the right wire connection to access the right screw (and may need to use a flat head screwdriver). You can then remove the 2 screws that hold the Valve Water Inlet on.

You will then need to loosen and the hose clamp that attaches the water line to the Valve Water Inlet. You may need to force it undone since the rubber connection is pretty secure around the water tube inlet.

Disconnect the plastic wire housing from the Valve Water Inlet and you should now have the Valve Water Inlet disconnected.

Reverse the order and reconnect everything and you should be good to go!

Double-check for any leaks prior to pushing everything back in :)

CHERI from CREEKSIDE, PA
Dishwasher was not filling up at the start of the cycle.
This was really easy. Have done it before on other older dishwashers in the past.
Turned off the breaker for the dishwasher. Turned off the water supply valve. Unscrewed the screws in the panel that hides the parts under the dishwasher. Unscrewed the screws anchoring the dishwasher to the counter. Slid the dishwasher out about a foot. Inlet valve was located on the front left side of the dishwasher. Unclipped the wire harness. Placed a cookie sheet under the water line. Unscrewed the water line from the inlet valve. Unscrewed the two Phillips head screws holding the valve to the dishwasher frame. Got the new part. Put the screws back into the frame. Reconnected the water line and wire harness. Slid the washer back into place. Turned on the water valve. Watched for leaks. Turned the breaker back on and started the cycle. Watched for leaks. Once I saw there weren’t any replaced the screws anchoring it to the counter and replaced the cover on the bottom. That was it! Took me longer to type out the steps than it did to actually do the repair.

Bill from NORTH HALEDON, NJ
The valve allowed water to fill the dishwasher when not in use.
This was the third time I replaced a fill valve in a Bosch diswasher, twice in this unit and once in a previous unit. I read the installation hints on your web site and want to add the following suggestion.

The notes on your web site say you can remove the valve from behind the toe face and pull it out to reach the hose and plug. I found that the Bosch designers called for both the hose and wire to on the short side. I found that pulling the dishwasher forward 6"" to 9"" allows you to access these connections from the side at least to hold them while making the connection. I hope this helps. Thank you, Bill

Inlet valve leaking at water connection
The valve has a plastic fitting to attach the the water line with a hose fitting. Was not carful enough with the original and damaged it attaching the water line. Ordered a replacement fitting. While it is possible to replace the water inlet valve without pulling the dishwasher out from the cabinet found it was easier to get at with the machine out. The video does and good job of showing the removal and replacing the valve. Easy job, don't be like me and be careful attaching the water line.

PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

I went to Youtube to get an idea of how to approach the repair. First turn off the electric power to the dishwasher. Then turn off the water valve that's connected to the dishwasher. Then disconnect both electrical and water lines connected to the dishwasher. Then remove the dishwasher from under the counter. Then place the dishwaher upside down. Remove the old hose,and install the new hose. Place the dishwasher right side up, and reconnect the water line, and electric line. Place the dishwasher back in place, and you're done.

If the hose is faulty, you will likely notice standing water in the washer tub after a cycle, mold growth, leaking, or water overflow. It is recommended to replace the drain hose promptly if it is faulty to ensure the proper functioning of your washer.

Installation Instructions
James from Evanston, IL
Drain hose was leaking.
I went to Youtube to get an idea of how to approach the repair. First turn off the electric power to the dishwasher. Then turn off the water valve that's connected to the dishwasher. Then disconnect both electrical and water lines connected to the dishwasher. Then remove the dishwasher from under the counter. Then place the dishwaher upside down. Remove the old hose,and install the new hose. Place the dishwasher right side up, and reconnect the water line, and electric line. Place the dishwasher back in place, and you're done.

Dishwasher Hose Drain Assembly
★★★★★

4 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16621806
Manufacturer Part Number AEM74333104
This LG drain hose assembly is a genuine OEM replacement that is compatible with various LG washers. The assembly includes the hose and plastic connectors. The flexible rubber hose transports used water from the washer tub out into a dedicated drainage system such as a laundry sink or standpipe. The drain hose may become clogged, dislodged, or damaged by loose items like coins in the laundry or by hard impacts from outside. If the hose is faulty, you will likely notice standing water in the washer tub after a cycle, mold growth, leaking, or water overflow. It is recommended to replace the drain hose promptly if it is faulty to ensure the proper functioning of your washer.

This filter works with the water pump in your dishwasher. It prevents debris from entering the pump and causing damage. As a result, the filter can occasionally become clogged or damaged, and will need to be replaced. A good indication of a damaged filter is if your dishwasher is not draining or cleaning the dishes properly. This filter has a gray plastic top and bottom that are approximately 5 inches in diameter. This is a genuine OEM part that comes directly from the manufacturer. To replace the filter, simply turn it counterclockwise to unlock, and then screw in the new filter

My filters had completely clogged up with hard deposits and food left on the dishes after running the dishwasher.
My filters had completely clogged up and had not cleaned my filters at all which was a no-no.I had lots of food left on the dishes after running my dishwasher, so I took bothp filters out and replaced them no tools required. I won’t be using powdered or liquid detergent for my dishwasher anymore only pods and promise to clean my filters once a month, so hopefully that’ll help keep them clean. Very easy replacement even for an old woman.

The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

The original plastic and rope in the closing mechanism broke and needed replacing.
Note: The diagram and part description misled me to think that each item was a quantity of one, so I ordered two since I wanted to replace the part on each side of the door. In fact, both the cable repair kit and the guide came with a quantity of two, so have an extra set that I will likely never need. As far as the replacement, it was quick and easy. The hardest part was pulling the dishwasher out from under the cabinet.

This part is a door balance link kit, also sometimes known as door cable or door spring cable kit, that helps support the door as it opens and closes by connecting to the dishwasher door hinges. The kit includes two door balance links and two door balance mounts with wheels, which will replace both the left and right sides. The only tool needed is a 5/16 nut driver.

Charles from DENNIS, MA
Dishwasher door became heavy and would fall to the floor if you didn't hold it up.
Removed mounting screws from sides of disher. Removed broken piece of connector assy still attached to hinge. Attached new connector assy to hinge then looped it around pulley with spring attached to opposite end. Need both hands to pull spring up to side of tub and connect it. I would suggest replacing both connector assemblies while you have the dishwasher pulled out. Push dishwasher back in and mount with screws.

Dishwasher Hinge Arm Link
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS259336
Manufacturer Part Number WD14X10009
The hinge link on your dishwasher connects the spring to the dishwasher door hinge. If the hinge link becomes cracked or damaged, you may not be able to shut or lock your dishwasher door properly. In this case, you will need to replace the hinge link. Pull out your dishwasher to inspect the hinge and spring, if the link is broken, it may be disconnected and on the ground already. If not, you can remove the hinge arm link by simply disconnecting it from the hinge and spring, then replacing it with the new part. The hinge arm link is a small piece of white plastic about an inch and a half long. It is sold individually, and is an OEM part from the manufacturer.

Dishwasher Door Cable Link
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS11747772
Manufacturer Part Number WP99003446
This is a part for your dishwasher. The door cable link helps to keep the door steady and give support to the weight of the door when it is being opened or closed. If you notice the door latch has failed or the door is not closing properly, this might indicate a need to have the door cable link replaced. To perform this repair, you will start by turning the power off from the appliance. You will need to pull the unit out of installation. To access the cables, you will need to remove the side panel. You should be able to see the cables underneath the panel once removed.

The door spring retainer is used in dishwashers. It attaches and holds the door spring to the support frame. If your dishwashers door keeps crashing, or both the door and dish rack are falling apart, then replacing the door spring retainer, which provides more flexibility, could be the solution to your symptoms. Before starting this project make sure to unplug the dishwasher as well as shut off the water supply before installing the spring retainer. Tools are not needed for this easy repair. Refer to the manufacturers installation instructions for best results and accuracy.

Installation Instructions
Avery from SEDALIA, CO
Cable had come off of roller
First went to U Tube to view installation instructions and location of part. It was fairly easy to replace since I had installed the unit. I was able to move the unit out enough without disconnecting any line since there was enough slack in all three connections, only shut the power off. I did use the new parts even though the older ones were not broken. The nylon pulley wheel had built up with lint causing the cable to come off.

Dishwasher door became heavy and would fall to the floor if you didn't hold it up.
Removed mounting screws from sides of disher. Removed broken piece of connector assy still attached to hinge. Attached new connector assy to hinge then looped it around pulley with spring attached to opposite end. Need both hands to pull spring up to side of tub and connect it. I would suggest replacing both connector assemblies while you have the dishwasher pulled out. Push dishwasher back in and mount with screws.

Dishwasher Lower Dishrack

PartSelect Number PS12730058
Manufacturer Part Number 20000533
This lower dishrack keeps dishes stable during the wash cycle and fits specific dishwasher models. It is crafted for durability and easy installation. Always consult your dishwasher’s manual to ensure compatibility and proper placement.
Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

Installation Instructions
Robert from CARNEGIE, PA
wheel assembly rusted and 1 wheel fell off causing rack to fail
replacing dishrack was simply removing old and sliding new onto track. however, removing and reinstalling water dispenser blade mounted on bottom of existing rack to new rack required much more time and effort .I needed to use flat screwdriver to pry plastic clamps apart and then a pair of channel locks to release assembly from original rack. It took some effort to finally accomplish . I believe all models that use this replacement rack would have this same issue with the dispenser blade and instructions for re-installation should accompany the new rack or better yet, new blade should be included on rack for those not familiar with using tools.

This lower dishrack keeps dishes stable during the wash cycle and fits specific dishwasher models. It is crafted for durability and easy installation. Always consult your dishwasher’s manual to ensure compatibility and proper placement.
Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

Left side door spring replacment
First thing I did was turn off the power to the dishwasher, then remove the racks. Remove the foot plates, remove the two top screws holding the dishwasher. Then using the socket set, retract the two foot stands to pull the dishwasher forward. You may not have to do this step as I had to get it over tile. The pully springs are on the sides, easily replaced. After replacing the springs and I recommend replacing both at the same time, put everything back. The hardest part will be the foot plates, there are two and getting them lined up and the screws back in is a bit of a challenge. Then you are done.

One of the nylon cables for the door counter balance broke
Preface: I had to remove the dishwasher anyway since I was replacing cabinets. So sitting in the garage it took less than 10 minutes to replace both sides. If I had to do this with dishwasher installed...2 screws pull dishwasher out 6 inches, unhook the spring, unhook the cable, hook new cable, rehook spring. Dido for the other side, slide dishwasher back in place reinstall attachment screws.
All that...max 30 minutes. So easy.

The door spring, used in dishwashers, adds tension to the door through the door hinge to keep it from opening too fast. If you have a door latch failure or your washer door drops too quickly when opened, it is best you replace this part to fix the problem. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for installation instructions and further repair guidance. Unplug your dishwasher from the power source before you begin this repair project as a safety precaution.

Installation Instructions
Gregory L from INDEPENDENCE, OH
Broken door spring allows the door to overextend to the floor if not propped.
Simple, removed screws securing machine in the cabinet, then pull the unit out of the cabinet space about 10 inches. Springs are accessible within this extension. You need strong hands to extend the springs and attach them. Once attached, push machine back in place and re-install the anchor screws. In my situation, only one spring was broken, so the attached side revealed the correct slot to place the hook on the top position, the bottom position has a plastic lead for the spring, and that lead is attached to a rope to the door hinge. Note: Replace BOTH springs, even if only one is broken.

PartSelect Number PS815938
Manufacturer Part Number 154430501
This door spring is manufactured for a dishwasher door. The door spring applies tension to the dishwasher door so that the door does not drop too quickly when it is opening. If the door drops too quickly, it could cause damage to the dishwasher door or dishwasher door hinges. This spring is sold individually. Check the spring on the opposite side of the dishwasher door, they often wear at the same rate so you may want to replace both springs for exact tension on either side. No tools are required for this repair. This is an OEM replacement part.

Daniel from Fremont, NE
Dishwasher door practically fell open
All I had to do was replace the spring and retainer on the side of the dishwasher which amounted to pulling it out far enough to reach the eyelet that the hook went into and then stretching it to the retainer attached on the other end. I really like partselect, I have done some things in the past and they are very helpful on the site and on the phone and I would recommend them to anyone and I would not normally do that unless it has been an excellent experience.

Bill from Cleveland Heights, OH
flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

Michael from Redmond, WA
One of the door tension springs and related plastic clip failed causing door to open under full weight
Per the recommendation from PartSelect.com, I purchased 2 new springs and 2 new clips - one set for each side. With the bottom cover plate removed below the door, I removed the remaining spring and clip and installed the 2 new springs and clips by hand. The door now opens with resistance and won't even stay completely opened unless the lower dishwasher tray is rolled out on it. it's like new.
This is the second repair to this dishwasher. Last year I replaced the door latch that had broken with a replacement purchased from partselect.com. That repair was also quite easy.
PartSelect's full part brochures by model made identifying the needed parts simple, and the replacement a breeze.
I even repaired my refrigerator ice maker a couple months ago after purchasing a new control module, and saving both a service fee and the probable full price for a new ice maker.
I've repaired my electric clothes dryer too, and hadn't even thought about all the repairs I'd done thanks to this website, until I told the story of my dishwasher.
I've probably saved $1000 already. Wow!
I love this site.

Reid from ALPHARETTA, GA
Dishes were not drying properly
Did the repair, but needed one extra step not described in video:

I followed the directions on the PartSelect Youtube video - very helpful! I do believe the heating element was the original culprit, as it had a ""burn"" area about the size of a dime that caused it to almost break into two parts. Obviously a point of failure.

BUT - after replacement, it still did not solve the problem of the dishes not drying.

After much web searching, I tried the diagnostic mode on the dishwasher, and that did a hard reset of the logic board and FIXED the problem.

So in all, it required both a new heating element AND a hard reset via diagnostic mode.

Dishwasher Spring, Lid
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11744874
Manufacturer Part Number WP8066018
The dishwasher lid spring helps open the dispenser cover in the soap box when the control releases the latch. If your dishwasher does not dispense detergent, is broken and worn out, or the door is not opening properly, replacing the dispenser spring could be the solution. For this replacement you will need needle nose pliers. First, release the cover on the detergent dispenser, then remove the cover from the shaft it hinges on. Pull the shaft from one side and remove the spring from the shaft. Next, replace with the new spring and engage the two open hooks into the soap cover. Finally, grasp the hook and pull it over tab on the side of the wash cup. Verify that it works properly by opening and closing the cap. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions.

HAROLD from FISHERSVILLE, VA
Worn out spring on detergent release box lid
First, examine very carefully how the old spring relates to the detergent release box lid. Note that the top of the spring has a square-end upside down ""U"" . This rests on a small ledge on the detergent box. Also note that on either end of the spring is a straight extension of the spring wire. These two ""legs"" must rest on the inside of the edge of the detergent box. Second, use a flat blade screw driver to pry the LID hinge pin from the mounting ""posts. Remove the pin, first noting the position of the spring. Reassemble the spring on the hinge pin in reverse order. Then snap the lid onto the spring using the two mounting ""posts"". NOTE: I used a very fine needle nose pliers to move the two spring ""legs"" behind the detergent box edge after I had mounted the lid. Flip the lid down to test if the spring pressure on the lid can be felt. Harold Kitzmann, Fishersville VA

Left side door spring replacment
First thing I did was turn off the power to the dishwasher, then remove the racks. Remove the foot plates, remove the two top screws holding the dishwasher. Then using the socket set, retract the two foot stands to pull the dishwasher forward. You may not have to do this step as I had to get it over tile. The pully springs are on the sides, easily replaced. After replacing the springs and I recommend replacing both at the same time, put everything back. The hardest part will be the foot plates, there are two and getting them lined up and the screws back in is a bit of a challenge. Then you are done.

One of the nylon cables for the door counter balance broke
Preface: I had to remove the dishwasher anyway since I was replacing cabinets. So sitting in the garage it took less than 10 minutes to replace both sides. If I had to do this with dishwasher installed...2 screws pull dishwasher out 6 inches, unhook the spring, unhook the cable, hook new cable, rehook spring. Dido for the other side, slide dishwasher back in place reinstall attachment screws.
All that...max 30 minutes. So easy.

Gregory L from INDEPENDENCE, OH
Broken door spring allows the door to overextend to the floor if not propped.
Simple, removed screws securing machine in the cabinet, then pull the unit out of the cabinet space about 10 inches. Springs are accessible within this extension. You need strong hands to extend the springs and attach them. Once attached, push machine back in place and re-install the anchor screws. In my situation, only one spring was broken, so the attached side revealed the correct slot to place the hook on the top position, the bottom position has a plastic lead for the spring, and that lead is attached to a rope to the door hinge. Note: Replace BOTH springs, even if only one is broken.

This door spring is manufactured for a dishwasher door. The door spring applies tension to the dishwasher door so that the door does not drop too quickly when it is opening. If the door drops too quickly, it could cause damage to the dishwasher door or dishwasher door hinges. This spring is sold individually. Check the spring on the opposite side of the dishwasher door, they often wear at the same rate so you may want to replace both springs for exact tension on either side. No tools are required for this repair. This is an OEM replacement part.

Dishwasher door practically fell open
All I had to do was replace the spring and retainer on the side of the dishwasher which amounted to pulling it out far enough to reach the eyelet that the hook went into and then stretching it to the retainer attached on the other end. I really like partselect, I have done some things in the past and they are very helpful on the site and on the phone and I would recommend them to anyone and I would not normally do that unless it has been an excellent experience.

flap to ice dispenser would not close
The flap to the ice dispenser would not close, which allowed the ice dispenser to frost up, freezing the water dispenser.

This was a simple fix. The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap. I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid. My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that. Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That allowed the touch pad to come off. I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid. I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.

The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid. After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier.

BUT - after replacement, it still did not solve the problem of the dishes not drying.

After much web searching, I tried the diagnostic mode on the dishwasher, and that did a hard reset of the logic board and FIXED the problem.

So in all, it required both a new heating element AND a hard reset via diagnostic mode.

Dishwasher Spring, Lid
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11744874
Manufacturer Part Number WP8066018
The dishwasher lid spring helps open the dispenser cover in the soap box when the control releases the latch. If your dishwasher does not dispense detergent, is broken and worn out, or the door is not opening properly, replacing the dispenser spring could be the solution. For this replacement you will need needle nose pliers. First, release the cover on the detergent dispenser, then remove the cover from the shaft it hinges on. Pull the shaft from one side and remove the spring from the shaft. Next, replace with the new spring and engage the two open hooks into the soap cover. Finally, grasp the hook and pull it over tab on the side of the wash cup. Verify that it works properly by opening and closing the cap. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions.

Installation Instructions
HAROLD from FISHERSVILLE, VA
Worn out spring on detergent release box lid
First, examine very carefully how the old spring relates to the detergent release box lid. Note that the top of the spring has a square-end upside down ""U"" . This rests on a small ledge on the detergent box. Also note that on either end of the spring is a straight extension of the spring wire. These two ""legs"" must rest on the inside of the edge of the detergent box. Second, use a flat blade screw driver to pry the LID hinge pin from the mounting ""posts. Remove the pin, first noting the position of the spring. Reassemble the spring on the hinge pin in reverse order. Then snap the lid onto the spring using the two mounting ""posts"". NOTE: I used a very fine needle nose pliers to move the two spring ""legs"" behind the detergent box edge after I had mounted the lid. Flip the lid down to test if the spring pressure on the lid can be felt. Harold Kitzmann, Fishersville VA

Broken wheels, Caps and Brackets. Couldn't hold dishes or wash right.
Just use a hexagonal driver to remove the Upper rack roller, screw the new ones in, place caps on the rail ends, and pop the new wheel on with some pliers! Simple and fun!

Dishwasher Rinse-Aid Dispenser Cap
★★★★★
★★★★★
51 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746426
Manufacturer Part Number WP8558307
The rinse aid cap (sometimes referred to as the dispenser cap), covers the rinse aid dispenser on the dishwasher door. If your dishwasher will not dispense detergent, or it is leaking detergent, there could be an issue with the rinse aid cap. Check the cap and its gasket for any damage or melting. If the cap has melted or it is not sealing the dispenser properly, the part should be replaced right away. This rinse aid cap comes with the gasket, so you should discard the existing gasket and rinse aid cap at the same time. The repair is relatively straightforward, and requires no tools.

James from Brandon, FL
Rinse Aid Cap was not secured and during dishwaher run the cap sat on the heating coil and melted.
This is simple, we don't know exactly how, but when we used the dishwasher the cap must not have been twisted correctly, and after the dishwasher shut down we discovered the cap was on the heating coil and melted. I know that it was easy to fix, but the reason I ordered it from PartsSelect was their price was much lower than Kitchen Aids, (the maker), Lowes (where we bought it), and other sites we searched for the part.

No water flowing into dishwasher
We tried cleaning out the filter and it clogged with a huge amount of gunk. We removed the gunk, scrubbed the filter, and tried running the dishwasher, but still no water. That took over an hour (not counting the time the dishwasher spent running). Then we tried your diagnosis center and it pointed to the flood switch or the water valve. I extracted the flood switch (another 30-60 minutes) to check it, and it also contained gunk and (significantly) did not rattle, which made me suspect the flood switch was the problem, so I ordered one. Once the replacement arrived, I checked it and the flood switch rattled, confirming that it should work properly. I spent 30-45 minutes installing it, plus the filter assembly and racks I had to remove to access it. Ran the dishwasher and everything came out sparkling clean. I don't know where the gunk came from, but if you aren't getting water and the filter is full of gunk, check the flood switch.

thought it could be due to the overfill control switch,so ordered one and replaced one in the washer. However, it did not solve the problem. Having a repair company coming to look at the dishwasher. Tipped the washer on its back and switch was readily accessable. Only had to open plastic covering over the switch, disconnect the wires and install new switch and reconnect the wires.

Dishwasher was not heating up when running and the heated dry was not working either
The dishwasher was not heating anymore. I suspected it was the float/flood switch, so I got that ordered. I went ahead and ordered the element also and I'm glad I did! Even though the element was good, when I tested it I loosened the nut holding the element in. When I retightened it there was NO WAY for me to get it watertight again and it kept dripping out the bottom. Mine was made in 2019, and the gaskets on the element that came with it were a terrible design - the metal flange on the element was about as big as the hole in the middle of the gasket so water just leaked between the gasket ""donut"" hole and the element with no way to seal. The element I bought for this repair just in case had a totally redesigned gasket that sealed right up and didn't have the same design issue. So beware, if you are fiddling with the element in your process, be sure the gasket will reseal - or just have an extra new element in case it is the old (bad) design.

The flood switch was easy to find (with dishwasher on its back) in a white housing under the black circular sump.

Getting the actual switch out of that housing took some doing. I ended up using 4 small kebab sticks - toothpicks might work better- all 4 tabs have to be pulled out at the same time.

So I ended up changing out both the element (which was good but started leaking) and the float switch.

IMPORTANT!!! Before you put the dishwasher back in, you probably need to reset the thermal cutoff (TCO) on the back of the dishwasher. Follow the wire up from the element and it is the first thing it goes to. There should be a small (3mm) black button that has popped out. Press that back in. With your repair (float switch or element) it should start heating again - at least mine did.

Mike from Bruceville, TX
Dishwasher was not heating up when running and the heated dry was not working either
The dishwasher was not heating anymore. I suspected it was the float/flood switch, so I got that ordered. I went ahead and ordered the element also and I'm glad I did! Even though the element was good, when I tested it I loosened the nut holding the element in. When I retightened it there was NO WAY for me to get it watertight again and it kept dripping out the bottom. Mine was made in 2019, and the gaskets on the element that came with it were a terrible design - the metal flange on the element was about as big as the hole in the middle of the gasket so water just leaked between the gasket ""donut"" hole and the element with no way to seal. The element I bought for this repair just in case had a totally redesigned gasket that sealed right up and didn't have the same design issue. So beware, if you are fiddling with the element in your process, be sure the gasket will reseal - or just have an extra new element in case it is the old (bad) design.

The flood switch was easy to find (with dishwasher on its back) in a white housing under the black circular sump.

Getting the actual switch out of that housing took some doing. I ended up using 4 small kebab sticks - toothpicks might work better- all 4 tabs have to be pulled out at the same time.

So I ended up changing out both the element (which was good but started leaking) and the float switch.

IMPORTANT!!! Before you put the dishwasher back in, you probably need to reset the thermal cutoff (TCO) on the back of the dishwasher. Follow the wire up from the element and it is the first thing it goes to. There should be a small (3mm) black button that has popped out. Press that back in. With your repair (float switch or element) it should start heating again - at least mine did.

No water to dish washer
After figuring out the problem wasn't the water inlet switch, I replaced the switch assembly for the water level float. Cut off supply water to dishwasher, removed the 2 screws holding switch assembly, and installed new switch. 15 minutes, very easy job.

This diverter valve assembly is sourced from the original manufacturer for use in dishwashers. The assembly controls the flow of water between different parts of the appliance. It directs water to either the upper or lower spray arms during different stages of the wash cycle, ensuring efficient cleaning of dishes throughout the dishwasher. The valve may become damaged or worn down over time due to frequent use and exposure to heat and chemicals. If the assembly is faulty, you will likely notice leaking from under the door and less water reaching the spray arms. It is best to replace the assembly promptly to avoid further damage to the dishwasher.

Water leak, no power,shorted control motherboard, diverter passive main assembly rubber hose had hole in it.
repair under warranty for Home Depot. Ordered new controller, new sump manifold, new piranh clamp kit, new diverter passive main assy, installation took 6 months. Could not finish as GE had changed the diverter to a new design with the same part number that the repairman had no knowledge of and there is no part available for the same configuration of the one that went bad, after I called GE tech line they were not aware of updates. Giving me the same numbers. The new design works if you order a new conduit main. As the old one in the dishwasher will not connect to the new Diverter. New deverter no. WD19X25278 and the new main conduit is the same as the old configuration no.WD12X21681 . The repair people and parts people are not yet aware of the design change and availability of parts, as most are out of stock and no updated pictures of the new design. Repair warranty washed their hands of this and Home Depot after 6 months gave me credit of my full price I bought this for 3 yrs ago. Repairing myself and sell.

The soap dispenser didn’t dispense the soap
After shutting off power to the dishwasher, I removed the two screws holding the door cover on the inside of the door sides, about 8 inches from the bottom of the door. I slid the cover down and off, and unplugged the wires to the dispenser. Then I removed the six screws holding the dispenser in place, removed the old dispenser, installed the new one, replaced the six screws and plugged the wires back in. The door cover and the two screws was all that was left. It took about ten minutes. Easy.

James from Naperville, IL
soap door latch broken, wouldn't hold soap for later release in middle of cycle like it was supposed to.
Turned off power to unit, 'cuz it has a solenoid lead to open the soap door.
Removed the phillips head screws that held the door together. The screw are located on the inside edge of the door, there are 10-12 of them.
Spearated the door shells carefully, trying not to disturb the location of the wiring in the middle of the door.

Found the 4 screws that hold the module assembly to the door from the inside, and removed them.
Popped the assembly out, cleaned the gasket-seat area and placed the new one in place.
Carefully tightened the 4 screws. It is easy to over-tighten them, so only turn them until you feel they are snug. Let the gasket do the work.
Attached the two solenoid control wires in the same positions they were in before they were removed from the old assembly.
Re-assembled the door halves, again taking care to not over-tighten the phillips-head screws. One got ""spun"" and I removed it and re-set it into some epoxy.
Returned power to the dishwasher, and stopped washing dishes by hand.
Note: the latch is now made with a plastic that is more dense, and likely will not fail as soon as the original one did. I think GE learned something about the durability of their component plastics since this was originally built.

Latch on detergent dispenser was broken
Reading the instructions posted, I realized that I only needed to remove the two lower screws on the inside of the dishwasher door. The lower front panel then came off easily. I unplugged the power to the dishwasher. I then removed the six screws holding the dispenser in place, and when loose I unplugged the two wires (I used a flat blade screwdrive to pry them a bit then they slid off -- note the red one was inside, lighter one outside). I put the new part in, put in all but the left screw with the hook. I then plugged the wires in, and fastened the left screw with the hook positioned around the wires. I put the panel back on, fastenet the two screws that hold it in, and plugged the dishwasher back in. It's working beautifully. All in all it was about 20 minutes.

Returned power to the dishwasher, and stopped washing dishes by hand.
Note: the latch is now made with a plastic that is more dense, and likely will not fail as soon as the original one did. I think GE learned something about the durability of their component plastics since this was originally built.

Latch on detergent dispenser was broken
Reading the instructions posted, I realized that I only needed to remove the two lower screws on the inside of the dishwasher door. The lower front panel then came off easily. I unplugged the power to the dishwasher. I then removed the six screws holding the dispenser in place, and when loose I unplugged the two wires (I used a flat blade screwdrive to pry them a bit then they slid off -- note the red one was inside, lighter one outside). I put the new part in, put in all but the left screw with the hook. I then plugged the wires in, and fastened the left screw with the hook positioned around the wires. I put the panel back on, fastenet the two screws that hold it in, and plugged the dishwasher back in. It's working beautifully. All in all it was about 20 minutes.

Dishwasher DIVERTER ASSEMBLY KIT
★★★★★

20 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12710077
Manufacturer Part Number WD19X25278
This diverter valve assembly is sourced from the original manufacturer for use in dishwashers. The assembly controls the flow of water between different parts of the appliance. It directs water to either the upper or lower spray arms during different stages of the wash cycle, ensuring efficient cleaning of dishes throughout the dishwasher. The valve may become damaged or worn down over time due to frequent use and exposure to heat and chemicals. If the assembly is faulty, you will likely notice leaking from under the door and less water reaching the spray arms. It is best to replace the assembly promptly to avoid further damage to the dishwasher.

Richard from THE DALLES, OR
Water leak, no power,shorted control motherboard, diverter passive main assembly rubber hose had hole in it.
repair under warranty for Home Depot. Ordered new controller, new sump manifold, new piranh clamp kit, new diverter passive main assy, installation took 6 months. Could not finish as GE had changed the diverter to a new design with the same part number that the repairman had no knowledge of and there is no part available for the same configuration of the one that went bad, after I called GE tech line they were not aware of updates. Giving me the same numbers. The new design works if you order a new conduit main. As the old one in the dishwasher will not connect to the new Diverter. New deverter no. WD19X25278 and the new main conduit is the same as the old configuration no.WD12X21681 . The repair people and parts people are not yet aware of the design change and availability of parts, as most are out of stock and no updated pictures of the new design. Repair warranty washed their hands of this and Home Depot after 6 months gave me credit of my full price I bought this for 3 yrs ago. Repairing myself and sell.

Craig from Austin, TX
latch on dispenser cover broke
Printed door assembly parts list and photo from KitchenAid website. (With the absence of instructions, it was a big help.) Remove door cover. You'll need a star driver bit. Remove the old dispenser. Note how the metal clamp and black cover sheet are positioned. Install the new dispenser. Insure the wiring harness is snapped in place. Replace the door cover. Not difficult; just some patience. One more hint ... be careful when taking the door cover off and you won't have to disconnect any other wiring.

The soap dispenser didn’t dispense the soap
After shutting off power to the dishwasher, I removed the two screws holding the door cover on the inside of the door sides, about 8 inches from the bottom of the door. I slid the cover down and off, and unplugged the wires to the dispenser. Then I removed the six screws holding the dispenser in place, removed the old dispenser, installed the new one, replaced the six screws and plugged the wires back in. The door cover and the two screws was all that was left. It took about ten minutes. Easy.

James from Naperville, IL
soap door latch broken, wouldn't hold soap for later release in middle of cycle like it was supposed to.
Turned off power to unit, 'cuz it has a solenoid lead to open the soap door.
Removed the phillips head screws that held the door together. The screw are located on the inside edge of the door, there are 10-12 of them.
Spearated the door shells carefully, trying not to disturb the location of the wiring in the middle of the door.

Found the 4 screws that hold the module assembly to the door from the inside, and removed them.
Popped the assembly out, cleaned the gasket-seat area and placed the new one in place.
Carefully tightened the 4 screws. It is easy to over-tighten them, so only turn them until you feel they are snug. Let the gasket do the work.
Attached the two solenoid control wires in the same positions they were in before they were removed from the old assembly.
Re-assembled the door halves, again taking care to not over-tighten the phillips-head screws. One got ""spun"" and I removed it and re-set it into some epoxy.
Returned power to the dishwasher, and stopped washing dishes by hand.
Note: the latch is now made with a plastic that is more dense, and likely will not fail as soon as the original one did. I think GE learned something about the durability of their component plastics since this was originally built.

Dishwasher was randomly beeping when not in use. Then eventually the display wouldn’t light up.
I first tested for 120volts to my dishwasher to verify it was getting power from my electrical panel. Then tested pins 2 and 5 on the control board to make sure there was 14 volts going to the user interface harness. After I verified that I knew it was the user interface that was bad. I watched a video I found on YouTube and followed it. This repair was fairly easy while watching the video and making sure that you use the correct pin out that comes in the box for your model. I’m not an appliance repair person and it took me about an hour start to finish. I’m going to attach the video I https://youtu.be/TI8cUjy5YOE

Manufacturer Part Number WD21X32165
This main control board is a genuine OEM part that is designed for dishwashers. It is responsible for controlling the operation of the dishwasher. It monitors all the dishwasher cycles including wash, rinse, dry, and sanitization. It receives input from the control panel and sends commands to various components of the dishwasher, such as the motor, pump, heating element, and sensors, to control the different cycles and functions of the appliance. Signs of a faulty control board include an unresponsive control panel, error codes, interrupted wash cycles, or a burning smell, which indicates a short circuit.

Dishwasher stopped working
This didn't work out well. At the beginning of September the control panel in the door started to work erratically, the lighted buttons did not light up as expected. I ordered a replacement board and installed it.
CONFIGURED UI SERVICE CONTROL Part #: PS16618944
This did not help, so I ordered another control board and installed it.
CONFIGURED SERVICE MACHINE CONTROL BOARD
Part #: PS16226072.
This did not help. This control board has a small orange fuse that looks like an old fashioned transistor. it was fine, as was the fuse on the previous control board.
There were two things about the Control boards that might help someone figure out what went wrong. When I took out the original control board, there was evidence of component overheating. When I installed the new control board there was a green light that was blinking.
I had hoped to complete this repair, but we have been without a dishwasher for over a month, so I bought a new one.
(I am a competent Instrumentation and Controls technician)
It could be that there is a bigger issue here; a major component failure.
If anyone has some suggestions to try, I would like to repair the machine and sell it as a used appliance.

DONALD from GOSHEN, IN
Most of the lights on the control panel had stopped working. There was no way to change the settings of the dishwasher.
When the part arrived, I was pretty sure it was the wrong part. The replacement part had an LED on it -- a box that stuck up about an inch above the circuit board. My dishwasher did not have an LED readout and I was pretty sure the LED would not fit in the space that was available. I was reluctant to take the dishwasher apart until I had the right part. The people at Part Select were helpful and together we looked at the schematic which did, indeed, seem to show a box sticking up from the circuit board. A YouTube video showed me how to take the door off its hinges, unscrew 4 screws and slide the inside of the door upwards. The circuit board went in fairly easily. There was space for the LED (even though it still doesn't show through the top) and now the lights work.

Dishwasher dead
Repaired with the help of You Tube videos. To repair: remove door (note! the door can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out, or disconnecting spring cables). To remove the door insert allen wrench in holes under door to hold the door in the remove/ install position. separate the inner and outer door (easily done) then remove and replace the User interface board. The hardest part was locating the holes to insert the allen wrenches (or anything similar) in to. Dishwasher worked after repair. In my case the dishwasher would come back to life for a short period if I turned the power off, and back on. I read somewhere that was a symptom of the bad UI board. I was lucky because that was the problem.

John from DANBURY, CT
UI Control panel would not light up and not work at all. Unplugging D/W failed to correct.
Unplug the dishwasher. Remove toe kick with 1/4 socket. Unplug, by pinching, door harness connector (White terminal connector) from PC board at bottom of dishwasher. Remove the door door using the Allen wrench, place it the hole on side of door hinge where pulley attaches. Unhook the pulley attachment at the door by using a vise grip to pull the plastic up and out. Don't break the plastic! Do the same for the other side. Remove Allen wrench. Pull door in and up at the same time. Take off 2 screws at bottom of door using 1/4 or 5/16 socket. Remove the vent cover (cap) using 2 flat head screwdrivers to loosen. Unscrew by hand. Slide toward the bottom, the inner door panel off from the outer door panel. You will see the door wire harness and some styrofoam insulation. Stand with outer door facing away from you. Remove UI by holding door handle, pressing it and pull the control head, up and away from you. It should come off from the top off the outer door panel. The UI will need to be removed from this housing. Unplug the UI harness connector. Remove 7 screw with a Phillips screwdriver or 1/4 socket. There are 2 clear plastic clips that need to be pressed in to release UI from the housing. Be careful, those clips are easy to snap. Place and snap new UI into the housing. Replace 7 screws. Reattach the connector pug to the new UI board. My personality was factory set. So, no jumper pins on my board. Snap the UI housing back onto the top of your door. Delicately, remove the styrofoam and unsnap the old harness to the soap and drying dispenser. Remove the rest of the old harness. Install the new door harness and use the plastic plugs on the harness to secure to the door. Install the styrofoam insulation. Attach the inner door panel to the outer door panel by sliding inner pan up toward the top. Replace the 2 screws at the bottom of the door. Attach vent cap by hand screwing it on. Position door at the dishwasher. Use Allen wrench or helper to hold at correct angle. Use a vise grip to grab the plastic pulley to attach it to the door hinge. Do the same on the other side. Plug in the harness connector to the PC board. Plug in the dishwasher and the UI should light up! Run a load and make sure no leaks are seen around the door. Replace toe kick.

Dishwasher Main Control Board
★★★★★

7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16873737
Manufacturer Part Number WD21X32165
This main control board is a genuine OEM part that is designed for dishwashers. It is responsible for controlling the operation of the dishwasher. It monitors all the dishwasher cycles including wash, rinse, dry, and sanitization. It receives input from the control panel and sends commands to various components of the dishwasher, such as the motor, pump, heating element, and sensors, to control the different cycles and functions of the appliance. Signs of a faulty control board include an unresponsive control panel, error codes, interrupted wash cycles, or a burning smell, which indicates a short circuit.

Dishwasher stopped working
This didn't work out well. At the beginning of September the control panel in the door started to work erratically, the lighted buttons did not light up as expected. I ordered a replacement board and installed it.
CONFIGURED UI SERVICE CONTROL Part #: PS16618944
This did not help, so I ordered another control board and installed it.
CONFIGURED SERVICE MACHINE CONTROL BOARD
Part #: PS16226072.
This did not help. This control board has a small orange fuse that looks like an old fashioned transistor. it was fine, as was the fuse on the previous control board.
There were two things about the Control boards that might help someone figure out what went wrong. When I took out the original control board, there was evidence of component overheating. When I installed the new control board there was a green light that was blinking.
I had hoped to complete this repair, but we have been without a dishwasher for over a month, so I bought a new one.
(I am a competent Instrumentation and Controls technician)
It could be that there is a bigger issue here; a major component failure.
If anyone has some suggestions to try, I would like to repair the machine and sell it as a used appliance.

DONALD from GOSHEN, IN
Most of the lights on the control panel had stopped working. There was no way to change the settings of the dishwasher.
When the part arrived, I was pretty sure it was the wrong part. The replacement part had an LED on it -- a box that stuck up about an inch above the circuit board. My dishwasher did not have an LED readout and I was pretty sure the LED would not fit in the space that was available. I was reluctant to take the dishwasher apart until I had the right part. The people at Part Select were helpful and together we looked at the schematic which did, indeed, seem to show a box sticking up from the circuit board. A YouTube video showed me how to take the door off its hinges, unscrew 4 screws and slide the inside of the door upwards. The circuit board went in fairly easily. There was space for the LED (even though it still doesn't show through the top) and now the lights work.

Robert from NEW CARLISLE, OH
Dishwasher dead
Repaired with the help of You Tube videos. To repair: remove door (note! the door can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out, or disconnecting spring cables). To remove the door insert allen wrench in holes under door to hold the door in the remove/ install position. separate the inner and outer door (easily done) then remove and replace the User interface board. The hardest part was locating the holes to insert the allen wrenches (or anything similar) in to. Dishwasher worked after repair. In my case the dishwasher would come back to life for a short period if I turned the power off, and back on. I read somewhere that was a symptom of the bad UI board. I was lucky because that was the problem.

Installation Instructions
John from DANBURY, CT
UI Control panel would not light up and not work at all. Unplugging D/W failed to correct.
Unplug the dishwasher. Remove toe kick with 1/4 socket. Unplug, by pinching, door harness connector (White terminal connector) from PC board at bottom of dishwasher. Remove the door door using the Allen wrench, place it the hole on side of door hinge where pulley attaches. Unhook the pulley attachment at the door by using a vise grip to pull the plastic up and out. Don't break the plastic! Do the same for the other side. Remove Allen wrench. Pull door in and up at the same time. Take off 2 screws at bottom of door using 1/4 or 5/16 socket. Remove the vent cover (cap) using 2 flat head screwdrivers to loosen. Unscrew by hand. Slide toward the bottom, the inner door panel off from the outer door panel. You will see the door wire harness and some styrofoam insulation. Stand with outer door facing away from you. Remove UI by holding door handle, pressing it and pull the control head, up and away from you. It should come off from the top off the outer door panel. The UI will need to be removed from this housing. Unplug the UI harness connector. Remove 7 screw with a Phillips screwdriver or 1/4 socket. There are 2 clear plastic clips that need to be pressed in to release UI from the housing. Be careful, those clips are easy to snap. Place and snap new UI into the housing. Replace 7 screws. Reattach the connector pug to the new UI board. My personality was factory set. So, no jumper pins on my board. Snap the UI housing back onto the top of your door. Delicately, remove the styrofoam and unsnap the old harness to the soap and drying dispenser. Remove the rest of the old harness. Install the new door harness and use the plastic plugs on the harness to secure to the door. Install the styrofoam insulation. Attach the inner door panel to the outer door panel by sliding inner pan up toward the top. Replace the 2 screws at the bottom of the door. Attach vent cap by hand screwing it on. Position door at the dishwasher. Use Allen wrench or helper to hold at correct angle. Use a vise grip to grab the plastic pulley to attach it to the door hinge. Do the same on the other side. Plug in the harness connector to the PC board. Plug in the dishwasher and the UI should light up! Run a load and make sure no leaks are seen around the door. Replace toe kick.

Doesn't complete dry cycle, no clean light, random noises as if door was closing
Removed toe kick. Removed door counter weights and placed door on soft surface. Removed two bolts(I was able to leave hinges in place) slid door panel down and off. Removed plastic snap fit cover and 4 bolts from UI board. Two of the stand-offs where broken, glued them back into place. Ensured jumpers were set to my model, snapped cover back in place and remounted door. The dishwasher now runs through the cycle and clean light but did not dry. That turned out to be a bad flood switch.

Dishwasher Configured User Interface Control Board
★★★★★
★★★★★
36 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137058
Manufacturer Part Number WD21X31902C
This is the user interface control board for various dishwashers. The user interface panel is what you directly interact with on your dishwasher to start and stop it and select the specific cycle you want. If your user interface panel is not responding and you have tested your dishwasher to ensure no other part could be at fault, it will need to be replaced immediately for it to regain function. Replacing this panel will requires some disassembly of your dishwasher, and will require tools like a screwdriver, wrench, and a pair of pliers. This OEM user interface panel measures approximately 14-inches wide and is sold individually.

Brian from MANSFIELD, MA
Dishwasher was randomly beeping when not in use. Then eventually the display wouldn’t light up.
I first tested for 120volts to my dishwasher to verify it was getting power from my electrical panel. Then tested pins 2 and 5 on the control board to make sure there was 14 volts going to the user interface harness. After I verified that I knew it was the user interface that was bad. I watched a video I found on YouTube and followed it. This repair was fairly easy while watching the video and making sure that you use the correct pin out that comes in the box for your model. I’m not an appliance repair person and it took me about an hour start to finish. I’m going to attach the video I https://youtu.be/TI8cUjy5YOE

Dishwasher gave the Ne code
When I turned the dishwasher over I discovered the PS3579323 diverter motor had failed due to a leak around the PS3536016 valve, check. No use replacing the diverter motor without fixing the leak so I turned the machine back over and disassembled the spray arms and top of the pump cover which reveled the case assy and the valve, check. Upon removal of the valve, check I discovered hair wrapped around it which compromised the MO31 packing and caused the leak. I probably could have just cleaned out the hair and reassembled it but because my installation is a bit of a pain I elected to change the case assy (because of a slight depression where the packing sets) the M031 packing, the MO25 valve, check, and the MO35 pump gasket. After that was accomplished I turned the machine upside down and replaced the MO26 diverter motor and reinstalled the dishwasher. End result: Ne code cleared, no leaks and now the dishes are clean on the top shelf and the wife is happy. There are great instruction videos on YouTube. Good luck!

Dishwasher Circulation Pump and Motor
★★★★★

27 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757388
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10757217
The circulation pump and motor is located near the bottom of the dishwasher. The part functions by spinning the impeller of the circulation pump, which is used to move the water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. Before you begin this repair, it is recommended that you pull your dishwasher out of the cabinet, so you can tip the dishwasher to one side and gain better access to the circulation pump and motor. Be sure to disconnect the power source and the water source to the dishwasher before you begin this repair. To complete this repair you will need a 1/4 inch nut driver and a 3/8 inch nut driver.

Loud grinding noise from water pump
Rather than remove the pump assembly - as an earlier post had done - I pulled the entire dishwasher out and laid it down on the floor. This allowed easy, direct access to the motor (that was the hard, messy part). From this point it was easy. Unplug the wiring, remove the retaining bolt, rotate the motor off the mounting brackets and pull it out. Then put the new one in. That was the easy part (about 15 minutes). The entire job took 2-and-a-half hours, most of which was taken in disconnecting, cleaning up and reconnecting the dishwasher. It's much quieter now.

Water leaking underneath dishwasher
The leak was dripping from the diverter motor. After removing dishwasher the diverter motor was found to be corroded. The shaft grommet looked good. A new diverter motor was installed and dishwasher connected. After running it awhile the leak reappeared. It seemed the only possible thing left was the shaft grommet. Of course the grommet comes as part of the belly assembly. After searching for a better and cheaper solution I ordered a Whirlpool WPW10195677 grommet and it solved the leak.

Water not draining from dishwasher
I had never done work on my dishwasher - I was a rookie in this area. Turns out the work itself was quite simple. Pulled the dishwasher out, turned it over, and was able to easily replace the motor and pump assembly. The drain tube was also an easy replace. A couple key notes:

1. I also purchased a new drain solenoid and impeller kit. Note that both of these items are already included in the Motor and Pump kit replacement. There is no need to by both, now I have extras.

2. The end of the drain tube has to be trimmed if you are routing the drain tube to an air gap mounted on your kitchen sink. You have to cut the large diameter end of the tube to get to the narrow portion that will fit on your air gap.

3. The first cycle you run with the new motor/pump assembly is noisy. When you first fire it up the components in the pump are all dry, and they squeal until the water gets to them. I initially thought I had done something wrong, but once the water started flowing all the peculiar sounds cleared up.

When this motor fails, the dishwasher will not wash or drain properly. Please keep in mind that this genuine OEM replacement part is sold separately from the spray arms.

Dishwasher gave the Ne code
When I turned the dishwasher over I discovered the PS3579323 diverter motor had failed due to a leak around the PS3536016 valve, check. No use replacing the diverter motor without fixing the leak so I turned the machine back over and disassembled the spray arms and top of the pump cover which reveled the case assy and the valve, check. Upon removal of the valve, check I discovered hair wrapped around it which compromised the MO31 packing and caused the leak. I probably could have just cleaned out the hair and reassembled it but because my installation is a bit of a pain I elected to change the case assy (because of a slight depression where the packing sets) the M031 packing, the MO25 valve, check, and the MO35 pump gasket. After that was accomplished I turned the machine upside down and replaced the MO26 diverter motor and reinstalled the dishwasher. End result: Ne code cleared, no leaks and now the dishes are clean on the top shelf and the wife is happy. There are great instruction videos on YouTube. Good luck!

Dishwasher Circulation Pump and Motor
★★★★★
★★★★★
27 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757388
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10757217
The circulation pump and motor is located near the bottom of the dishwasher. The part functions by spinning the impeller of the circulation pump, which is used to move the water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. Before you begin this repair, it is recommended that you pull your dishwasher out of the cabinet, so you can tip the dishwasher to one side and gain better access to the circulation pump and motor. Be sure to disconnect the power source and the water source to the dishwasher before you begin this repair. To complete this repair you will need a 1/4 inch nut driver and a 3/8 inch nut driver.

Loud grinding noise from water pump
Rather than remove the pump assembly - as an earlier post had done - I pulled the entire dishwasher out and laid it down on the floor. This allowed easy, direct access to the motor (that was the hard, messy part). From this point it was easy. Unplug the wiring, remove the retaining bolt, rotate the motor off the mounting brackets and pull it out. Then put the new one in. That was the easy part (about 15 minutes). The entire job took 2-and-a-half hours, most of which was taken in disconnecting, cleaning up and reconnecting the dishwasher. It's much quieter now.

The motor and pump assembly is a critical component of select dishwashers, responsible for circulating water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. This ensures thorough cleaning of dishes by maintaining a steady flow of water at optimal pressure. This replacement part functions like the original, though minor design variations may exist. Before installing, disconnect the power supply at the circuit breaker to prevent electrical hazards. Wearing protective gloves is recommended to ensure a safe installation.

Water leaking underneath dishwasher
The leak was dripping from the diverter motor. After removing dishwasher the diverter motor was found to be corroded. The shaft grommet looked good. A new diverter motor was installed and dishwasher connected. After running it awhile the leak reappeared. It seemed the only possible thing left was the shaft grommet. Of course the grommet comes as part of the belly assembly. After searching for a better and cheaper solution I ordered a Whirlpool WPW10195677 grommet and it solved the leak.

Water not draining from dishwasher
I had never done work on my dishwasher - I was a rookie in this area. Turns out the work itself was quite simple. Pulled the dishwasher out, turned it over, and was able to easily replace the motor and pump assembly. The drain tube was also an easy replace. A couple key notes:

1. I also purchased a new drain solenoid and impeller kit. Note that both of these items are already included in the Motor and Pump kit replacement. There is no need to by both, now I have extras.

2. The end of the drain tube has to be trimmed if you are routing the drain tube to an air gap mounted on your kitchen sink. You have to cut the large diameter end of the tube to get to the narrow portion that will fit on your air gap.

3. The first cycle you run with the new motor/pump assembly is noisy. When you first fire it up the components in the pump are all dry, and they squeal until the water gets to them. I initially thought I had done something wrong, but once the water started flowing all the peculiar sounds cleared up.

Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

Dishwasher does not finish its cycle. The sanitizer light flashes red and there is soapy water left in the dishwasher.
I replaced the thermostat (part # PS11750035) along with the heating element (part # PS9494999) and the turbidity sensor (part # PS11757214). I also checked the filter (part # PS11759673) and it was very clean with no holes. The dishwasher still has water and soap suds standing in dishwasher after I ran it through different cycles. Also, when I run the sanitize cycle the sanitize light flashes red at the end. It doesn’t appear to completely filling with water. Also my hot water temperature is 130 degrees after running for 1 minute. I am at a loss! Any suggestions?

Water in dishwasher did not heat up. Dishes came out dirty and greasy. Some fungus started to grow in dishwasher.
Unplugged the dishwasher. Closed and disconnected the water supply. Removed two screws that attached the dishwasher to the countertop. Pulled the dishwasher out from underneath the countertop. Laid the dishwasher on its side to access the bottom. The high limit thermostat had shorted out and showed signs of electrical burn. I removed the high limit thermostat by unscrewing the single screw that holds it in place. I then pulled the two electrical terminals off the high limit thermostat . One terminal (i.e. small electrical plug connecting electrical wire to high limit thermostat) was burned badly. I cut it off the wire and attached a generic terminal bought at local hardware store (six for $3). The other terminal was fine. I plugged the new high limit thermostat in and attached it with the single screw to the dish washer. Put the dishwasher back in place. Test ran dish washer and dishes came out shiny, clean and dry.

PartSelect Number PS8731293
Manufacturer Part Number 00651435
Installation Instructions
James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

PartSelect Number PS11766992
Manufacturer Part Number WD34X21699
This is the user interface cover, which goes over the user interface panel on compatible dishwashers, so you can easily select and adjust your dishwasher cycle settings. If this interface cover is physically broken and/or not allowing you to select and change cycles on your dishwasher, it should be replaced. Replacing it will require some disassembly of your dishwasher, so tools like a socket wrench and screwdriver will be needed. This cover panel is sold individually and does not come with the computerized control panel included.

Dishwasher PRESSURE SENSOR ASM
★★★★★
★★★★★
2 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12741258
Manufacturer Part Number WD21X25468
This is a manufacturer-built pressure sensor for dishwashers. This pressure sensor, also known as a pressure switch, is designed to monitor the water pressure, communicate with the control board of the dishwasher, and accurately calculate the necessary amount of water for the washing cycle. If this pressure sensor is bad or not working properly, it will cause over and underfilling of your dishwasher, as well as excessive noise while in operation. To replace this pressure sensor, you will need a screwdriver and wrench to gain access and remove this part, and further disassembly of your dishwasher may be required. This sensor is sold individually and does not come with any other parts.

Installation Instructions
Linda from MYRTLE BEACH, SC
Dishwasher would not fill with water and would shut off
I found it online! There were step by step instructions that were easy to understand. I have never had to do anything like this in my life, only recently had to start doing everything around the house myself due to husband's illness.
The repairman came out, charged me $100 to determine what the dishwasher needed & left me with the part number. He was going to charge me $389 to install the part and they were over charging for the part. The repairman suggested I just get a new dishwasher.
I ordered the part from the website at 1/2 the price that the other place charges and found it on line. With the step by step instructions and the online page, I successfully installed it MYSELF. Saved me a ton of $$.
I LOVE the website
Thank You!!!!

Installation Instructions
Mark from Lancaster, NY
Failed diagonistics test for OWI sensor
Pulled the dishwasher out from the counter, on the lower right hand side, about mid way back there is a bundle of all yellow wires, follow that to the sensor which mounts into the bottom of the wash tub. The sensor is easily removed by grasping it by hand and turn it about a half turn (can't remember which direction). It then just pulls out. Disconnect the wire bundle by pushing on the retaining clip and the install is the reverse.

Dishwasher Leak Detector Sensor
★★★★★
★★★★★
1 Review
PartSelect Number PS4222735
Manufacturer Part Number DD94-01062A
This is a leak sensor designed for use with a range of Samsung dishwashers. This sensor is designed to detect if water begins leaking from the water supply. If/when it detects a leak, it stops the water being supplied to the dishwasher, preventing damage and mess to the dishwasher and home of the user. This sensor may fail when it is exposed to water, so it is important to check this sensor occasionally to ensure it still works. This is an OEM leak sensor, and attaches via its wire harness underneath the dishwasher, so tools like a screwdriver will be necessary. This sensor comes individually and does not come with any other parts or securing screws.

Installation Instructions
Linda from MYRTLE BEACH, SC
Dishwasher would not fill with water and would shut off
I found it online! There were step by step instructions that were easy to understand. I have never had to do anything like this in my life, only recently had to start doing everything around the house myself due to husband's illness.
The repairman came out, charged me $100 to determine what the dishwasher needed & left me with the part number. He was going to charge me $389 to install the part and they were over charging for the part. The repairman suggested I just get a new dishwasher.
I ordered the part from the website at 1/2 the price that the other place charges and found it on line. With the step by step instructions and the online page, I successfully installed it MYSELF. Saved me a ton of $$.
I LOVE the website
Thank You!!!!

Installation Instructions
Mark from Lancaster, NY
Failed diagonistics test for OWI sensor
Pulled the dishwasher out from the counter, on the lower right hand side, about mid way back there is a bundle of all yellow wires, follow that to the sensor which mounts into the bottom of the wash tub. The sensor is easily removed by grasping it by hand and turn it about a half turn (can't remember which direction). It then just pulls out. Disconnect the wire bundle by pushing on the retaining clip and the install is the reverse.

Daniel from AUBURN, IN
dishwasher not draining, dishes dirty
replacing the sensor was simple, just unplug and turn it out, but didn't solve the problem, it's a float sensor that doesn't show up on the tech sheet in the dishwasher or anywhere in troubleshooting on the internet I could find.

Dishwasher Leak Detector Sensor
★★★★★
★★★★★
1 Review
PartSelect Number PS4222735
Manufacturer Part Number DD94-01062A
This is a leak sensor designed for use with a range of Samsung dishwashers. This sensor is designed to detect if water begins leaking from the water supply. If/when it detects a leak, it stops the water being supplied to the dishwasher, preventing damage and mess to the dishwasher and home of the user. This sensor may fail when it is exposed to water, so it is important to check this sensor occasionally to ensure it still works. This is an OEM leak sensor, and attaches via its wire harness underneath the dishwasher, so tools like a screwdriver will be necessary. This sensor comes individually and does not come with any other parts or securing screws.

Installation Instructions
Chester from North Las Vegas, NV
Top rack had the plastic coating coming off
Had to replace the top rack in the dishwasher. Removing the top rack was a tricky. Have to push the tab out not in on the stopper ends of the rack. Unscrew the bolts on the water sprayer. Need to slide the sprayer instead of unclipping it. Real easy to do once it is realized. Should have taken 30 minutes if I knew this in advance

Great Deal on a Dishwasher...
I got a discounted dishwasher which looked in perfect condition. It had been returned. When I got the dishwasher home and installed I found out why they had returned it...they had dropped it, on the left side and broken a couple things. They also decided not to return some parts. Partselect.com made it easy to order the parts I needed and I had it fixed as soon as they arrived. Thanks!

Installation Instructions
Margaret from San Diego, CA
Wanted to change beige dishwasher front to black.
First , I went outside and turned the breaker for the dishwasher off. Next,I removed the screws that held the bottom 2 pieces, that rest on the floo,r in place. Then removed the two beige metal pcs. . Next I replaced them with the 2 black pieces I had ordered and secured them with the 2 black screws I had received as part of my order. Then I removed the scews from the inside of the door of my KitchenAid Dishwasher. This released both the front bottom panel and the control panel. . I took the beige bottom door panel off and moved the insulation piece from the back of thebeige panel to the back of the black panel. Then I intalled the new black panel I ordered and resecured it with two screws until I had finished with the control panel switch out.
I had to unplug an electronic tape from the inside of the beige control panel and plug the same tape back into the black control panel. I also had to remove the beige handle that was on the inside of the control panel, attached to the door, and replace it with the new black one I'd received. I then installed the black control panel and reattached it with screws and finished replacing the rest of the screws I had removed from the inside of the door.
I tested the handle to make sure it opened the door and locked it like it should and then went outside and turned the breaker back on. Came in and turned on the dishwasher and did a load of dishes. It looks awesome, matches the rest of my black appliances and I am very proud to have done it myself. I also wanted to thank the customer service lady who was so great to work with on the phone. I would shop with you again.

Great Deal on a Dishwasher...
I got a discounted dishwasher which looked in perfect condition. It had been returned. When I got the dishwasher home and installed I found out why they had returned it...they had dropped it, on the left side and broken a couple things. They also decided not to return some parts. Partselect.com made it easy to order the parts I needed and I had it fixed as soon as they arrived. Thanks!

Bezel fell off - broken tabs
Fiddled around for a few minutes trying to fit the tabs in the holes. Finally figured out it just twisted to put it back on. Very simple but it looked more complicated that it was.

New Black Single Metal Access Panel Replacement Kit. Replaces old two part toe kick plates. Reuse insulation off old panel or see Recommended Parts.
Installation Instructions
Margaret from San Diego, CA
Wanted to change beige dishwasher front to black.
First , I went outside and turned the breaker for the dishwasher off. Next,I removed the screws that held the bottom 2 pieces, that rest on the floo,r in place. Then removed the two beige metal pcs. . Next I replaced them with the 2 black pieces I had ordered and secured them with the 2 black screws I had received as part of my order. Then I removed the scews from the inside of the door of my KitchenAid Dishwasher. This released both the front bottom panel and the control panel. . I took the beige bottom door panel off and moved the insulation piece from the back of thebeige panel to the back of the black panel. Then I intalled the new black panel I ordered and resecured it with two screws until I had finished with the control panel switch out.
I had to unplug an electronic tape from the inside of the beige control panel and plug the same tape back into the black control panel. I also had to remove the beige handle that was on the inside of the control panel, attached to the door, and replace it with the new black one I'd received. I then installed the black control panel and reattached it with screws and finished replacing the rest of the screws I had removed from the inside of the door.
I tested the handle to make sure it opened the door and locked it like it should and then went outside and turned the breaker back on. Came in and turned on the dishwasher and did a load of dishes. It looks awesome, matches the rest of my black appliances and I am very proud to have done it myself. I also wanted to thank the customer service lady who was so great to work with on the phone. I would shop with you again.

4 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8729301
Manufacturer Part Number 00628998
This door handle end cap is supplied directly by the manufacturer for use with dishwashers. It is a genuine OEM part that is designed to fit just like the original piece. The end cap is made of highly durable plastic, and it is responsible for securing the end of the handle on the dishwasher door. It protects the handle from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear, which can occur over time. It also contributes to the appearance of the dishwasher by concealing any exposed screws and providing a finished look to the handles. When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.

11 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11758453
Manufacturer Part Number 12012913
This is a door handle, which is is installed at the top of your dishwasher door and allows you to open and close it. However, if this part is missing or broken, the opening and closing your dishwasher will be more difficult, and the overall visual appearance will be less pleasing. Replacing this door handle will require a Phillips-head and flat-head screwdriver, as well as a set of pliers, and some disassembly of your dishwasher will be necessary. This door handle is an individual OEM part and does not come with any other accessories for your dishwasher.

Michael from CASTLE ROCK, CO
Replacing the pocket handle on a Bosch Dishwasher
I removed the 3 #20 torn screws in the handle, and the six #20 tore screws inside the door that hold the outer door skin in place.

The plastic handle has a series of molded hooks that allow it to snap into the stainless steel skin.

To avoid damaging the skin, use a utility knife to cut behind the two large hooks on the bottom of the handle and the one on each end. One trimmed, the handle easily slides out of the door skin.

The new one will effortlessly snap in-place, then reposition the door skin and fasten with the 9 screw previously removed.

Thomas from Austin, TX
Broken handle on dishwasher
Ordered new part(s), parts arrived in a few days, removed the 6 screws holding the control panel cover onto the dishwasher door (requires a torx driver), removed control panel cover (carefully, so as not to break any wires on the wiring harness from the door to the computer board), unscrewed/removed door switch, popped off the the two plastic brackets holding the door handle assembly (door handle, latch bracket, door latch actuator, spring) to the front door, removed the broken handle, installed the new handle, reversed steps, done. Works like a champ.

The one thing I did do at the same time is notice that there's only one return spring for the door handle (even though both the handle and latch bracket have hooks for springs on both sides. I suspect this is what caused the door handle to break in the first place (the spring causes uneven tension on the handle, which over time caused the arms on the handle to catch and break). So I also ordered a second spring, and when I attached the new door handle to the latch bracket assembly I also installed return springs on both sides. With even tension, the handle doesn't tend to twist when it raises and lowers the latch, so hopefully won't break again. Just a thought while you have the unit off the dishwasher.

This is a handle actuator for your dishwasher. It is made of black plastic, and is sold individually. The handle actuator is found in the control panel, and it releases the door latch when you lift the handle. If your current handle actuator is cracked or broken, you may not be able to open your dishwasher door, or the door will not close properly. The dishwasher also may not be able to start, and if this is the case, you will need to replace this part.

Stephen from Houston, TX
Door handle actuator was broken.
I removed the screws on the inside of the door assembly, which allows the inside of the door to seperate from the outside. The escuchen (control panel) was easy to remove - the handle actuator is inside the control panel. The handle assembly was easy to take apart and re-assemble with the new handle and spring. I then inserted the control panel back into the outside door and reattached all of the screws with a power drill. This was a repair that a GE-authorized service tech told me was going to be over $540 - he claimed the control panel and door handle/actuator was a single assembly. In the end this repair cost me $14 in parts and 15 minutes of time. I complained to GE Consumer Affairs and they rebated the tech house call back to me in 5 business days.

Exterior Control Panel broke next to handle
By way of the circuit breaker. I first turned off the electricity to the dishwasher.
I removed all of the screws from the front cover, three down each side, and removed the cover exposing the front screws holding exterior control panel, I removed those screws and the screws on the back side of the panel and removed the panel.
I took all of the control buttons from the broken piece and installed them and the handle strip to the new piece. I then put the new panel in place and using the original screws secured it to the machine.
Also using the original screws, I secured the front cover to the machine.
I turned the electricity on to the dishwasher and ran a test cycle. It worked and the handle opens the machine the way it was designed.

Dishwasher Door Handle Actuator
★★★★★
★★★★★
7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2337860
Manufacturer Part Number WD13X10045
This is a handle actuator for your dishwasher. It is made of black plastic, and is sold individually. The handle actuator is found in the control panel, and it releases the door latch when you lift the handle. If your current handle actuator is cracked or broken, you may not be able to open your dishwasher door, or the door will not close properly. The dishwasher also may not be able to start, and if this is the case, you will need to replace this part.

Installation Instructions
Stephen from Houston, TX
Door handle actuator was broken.
I removed the screws on the inside of the door assembly, which allows the inside of the door to seperate from the outside. The escuchen (control panel) was easy to remove - the handle actuator is inside the control panel. The handle assembly was easy to take apart and re-assemble with the new handle and spring. I then inserted the control panel back into the outside door and reattached all of the screws with a power drill. This was a repair that a GE-authorized service tech told me was going to be over $540 - he claimed the control panel and door handle/actuator was a single assembly. In the end this repair cost me $14 in parts and 15 minutes of time. I complained to GE Consumer Affairs and they rebated the tech house call back to me in 5 business days.

Installation Instructions
Gary from LOUISVILLE, KY
Exterior Control Panel broke next to handle
By way of the circuit breaker. I first turned off the electricity to the dishwasher.
I removed all of the screws from the front cover, three down each side, and removed the cover exposing the front screws holding exterior control panel, I removed those screws and the screws on the back side of the panel and removed the panel.
I took all of the control buttons from the broken piece and installed them and the handle strip to the new piece. I then put the new panel in place and using the original screws secured it to the machine.
Also using the original screws, I secured the front cover to the machine.
I turned the electricity on to the dishwasher and ran a test cycle. It worked and the handle opens the machine the way it was designed.

Installation Instructions
Dave from Littleton, CO
Parts were old and worn out
The repair was easy. A couple turns of a screwdriver was all that was necessary to remove the rollers and slide assembly. The I simple installed the new rollers. Slid the slide into place between the rollers and then added the back caps to the slide. Replaced the rack rollers on the top basket and then slid it into position between the new slides. Once in place, I attached the end caps to the front of the slide. Simple and quick.

Dishwasher Timer Knob

8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS258821
Manufacturer Part Number WD09X10025
This part is the replacement timer knob for your dishwasher. It is made of white plastic with a gray indicator line, and it is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. The timer knob turns on the shaft and allows you to choose the correct setting for your dishwasher. The main reason you would be replacing this knob, is if the old one is broken or stripped, and it will not turn the shaft. To replace this knob, carefully remove it from the shaft, and replace it with the new one. This part is sold individually and is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

PartSelect Number PS16746079
Manufacturer Part Number 11050210
Installation Instructions
Scott from MOUNT JULIET, TN
Pressure washer would not maintain pressure
Determined that the unloader valve was leaking.
Removed the unloader valve from valve body.
I could see a crack in the nylon portion of the valve. This would not let the relief valve operate.
Went to the internet (Part Select) and found the replacement valve. There are a lot of different sizes of unloader valve. Partselect help me select the correct valve.
The key was the valve body, the unloader valve inserts into the valve body. There are two types of valve bodies, a 4 bolt and a 5 bolt. They look the same but do not interchange. I needed the 4 bolt.
I was nervous as the new unloader valve was a different construction than my old valve. It worked perfectly.
Replacement was easy.
Locate the unloader valve. It is part of the pump body. You can recognize it by the spring extending out from the valve body.
Remove the “U” shaped clip that holds the unloader valve in the valve body.
I used pliers to grab the spring and pulled the unloader valve from the valve body. It took a little pulling pressure to remove.
Note the orientation of the unloader valve I. The valve body. You want to install the unloader valve with the same orientation.
It may take a little force to seat the valve. I used a little silicone grease to lube the valve. A small tap on the end of the valve to insure it is fully seated.
It has to be seated so the “U” shaped retaining clip can be inserted to hold the unloader valve in place. Again, a light tap was necessary to fully seat the clip.
That was it, I was back operating my pressure washer

Water Not Draining.
There are videos on YouTube that demonstrate the repair process better than I can type. I will say I'm not certain why the dishwasher wasn't draining other than when I removed the chamber collection and repositioned the ball filter it would work as it should until the next time. Replacing the sump, chamber collection, and ball filter was a shot in the dark. The tub insulation was an improvement on noise. The first cycle seemed to be draining water better. Overall the removal and installation of the parts was not difficult.

This is a timer for use in dishwashers. The timer is responsible for ensuring the various parts of the dishwasher cycle activate at the correct time. If the timer is in any way broken or faulty, it will cause your dishwasher to not start, take longer than normal or finish too early, and will need to be replaced as soon as possible. This timer features a mostly metal construction and features a wire terminal on its top side. Replacing this timer will require a few tools, like a screwdriver or socket wrench, and some disassembly of your dishwasher will be necessary. This timer is an individual OEM part, so it does not come with any accessories.

Water would not drain.
The washer ran through a full cycle, but the water didn't drain out. I pulled out the drain vent and checked for foreign objects. Also checked at the drain hose/disposal joint and there was no blockage. After removing the bottom panels I noticed the solenoid was shot. Cylinder was burnt up and stuck solid in the up position. I went online and found that a main cause of this can be from the timer causing the solenoid to over exert and burn out. I decided if I was going to order parts and dig into a repair I should replace both. For the timer it is just a matter of unscrewing the inner door panel and unplugging the old timer. Then inserting new one. Couple of things I ran into were the door is no longer heavy enough to stay down so I grabbed a waffle iron as a weight to hold it down. Also will need to unscrew the set screw on the Door lock latch's bottom side. Pay close attention to how it was together helps. For the solenoid I removed the main screws holding the unit in place as well as the c-clip holding the plastic arm. Undo the spring and plug and the whole unit comes out. Reverse these steps with the new solenoid to install.

Dishwasher timer not working.
Our older dishwasher would get hung up and not proceed to its next wash cycle. I removed the power to the unit took it apart to inspect. I figured it was somthing to do with the timer. I unhooked the power connection to the motor for the timer. I then plugged the unit back in and checked voltage to the timer motor. I had power at the connection. I then plugged the connection back into the timer motor. The timer motor still did not function. I went online looking for parts and found this site www.partselect.com. All the parts needed to make repairs were listed and good pictures showing the parts I needed. The part was recived a couple days later. I installed the new timer plugged the unit it and it works great now. I even purched a couple other parts to make the unit good as new.

Also will need to unscrew the set screw on the Door lock latch's bottom side. Pay close attention to how it was together helps. For the solenoid I removed the main screws holding the unit in place as well as the c-clip holding the plastic arm. Undo the spring and plug and the whole unit comes out. Reverse these steps with the new solenoid to install.

Dishwasher timer not working.
Our older dishwasher would get hung up and not proceed to its next wash cycle. I removed the power to the unit took it apart to inspect. I figured it was somthing to do with the timer. I unhooked the power connection to the motor for the timer. I then plugged the unit back in and checked voltage to the timer motor. I had power at the connection. I then plugged the connection back into the timer motor. The timer motor still did not function. I went online looking for parts and found this site www.partselect.com. All the parts needed to make repairs were listed and good pictures showing the parts I needed. The part was recived a couple days later. I installed the new timer plugged the unit it and it works great now. I even purched a couple other parts to make the unit good as new.

PartSelect Number PS17626228
Manufacturer Part Number WD21X33641
This is a timer for use in dishwashers. The timer is responsible for ensuring the various parts of the dishwasher cycle activate at the correct time. If the timer is in any way broken or faulty, it will cause your dishwasher to not start, take longer than normal or finish too early, and will need to be replaced as soon as possible. This timer features a mostly metal construction and features a wire terminal on its top side. Replacing this timer will require a few tools, like a screwdriver or socket wrench, and some disassembly of your dishwasher will be necessary. This timer is an individual OEM part, so it does not come with any accessories.

Jay from North Liberty, IA
Water would not drain.
The washer ran through a full cycle, but the water didn't drain out. I pulled out the drain vent and checked for foreign objects. Also checked at the drain hose/disposal joint and there was no blockage. After removing the bottom panels I noticed the solenoid was shot. Cylinder was burnt up and stuck solid in the up position. I went online and found that a main cause of this can be from the timer causing the solenoid to over exert and burn out. I decided if I was going to order parts and dig into a repair I should replace both. For the timer it is just a matter of unscrewing the inner door panel and unplugging the old timer. Then inserting new one. Couple of things I ran into were the door is no longer heavy enough to stay down so I grabbed a waffle iron as a weight to hold it down. Also will need to unscrew the set screw on the Door lock latch's bottom side. Pay close attention to how it was together helps.

Leakage along bottom of door panel during wash/rinse
The air inlet strip has a flap and two smaller side flaps that seal the bottom of the inner door to the bottom pan that hold the water. The flaps don't form a watertight seal as they only serve to prevent the water surging during wash and rinse cycles from splashing out of the bottom pan onto the floor under the door. What I learned after dismantling the door is that the problem I was having with water dripping from the bottom of the bottom of the outer door was being caused by a loose upper round louvered vent and not he lower vent strip. If the lower vent strip were the problem, water would leak from the front lip of the bottom pan, which is located well behind the face of the front door panel.

Here's my recommendation on the lower vent srtip repair. Turn off the power to the unit at you breaker panel. The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainleess steel door panel. To access the screws the outer door panel must be removed. Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door. Don't remove the two torx screws top dead center as they hold the door latch. After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position. Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door. The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed. The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws. There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and holds electrical wiring. I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4"" hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip scews easier. Lay flat on the floor. With a 3/16"" nutdriver or socket wrench each of the five vent strip screws can be removed. It's a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done. Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one. Make sure it fits snugly into the slot. Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the stip securely in place while screws are reinserted from the opposite side. Reassemble everything in reverse order.

It was when I had the outer door panel off that I noticed my problem was water getting past the upper round louver vent seal and thus running down the inside of the outer panel. Simple fix was to remove and clean the scale residue from the parts and door. Then reassemble the vent and twitst tighten the vent to compress the rubber seal on the inside face of the door.

Installation Instructions
stephen from west islip, NY
door insert all scatched up
Took me a while to figure out that the bottom plastic strip is all that holds in the panel. Once it is removed , it pulls out easily When the new panel arrived,just slide it up into the top grooove, and push the bottom strip back into its groove. The front looks like new!

Dishwasher Leveling Leg
PartSelect Number PS557020
Manufacturer Part Number 8193716
Leveling leg Now includes two different sizes. Use the one for your model. If you need two legs you will need to purchase a QTY of two of this kit.
Installation Instructions
Phil from Fairfax, VA
Water was leaking.
This unit was unique that whole motor assembly was held in its place by two plastic clip. The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak. Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off. 4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place. Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface. Put spray arm back on. Finished.

Installation Instructions
Phil from Fairfax, VA
Water was leaking.
This unit was unique that whole motor assembly was held in its place by two plastic clip. The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak. Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off. 4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place. Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface. Put spray arm back on. Finished.

This part is the replacement tub trim for your dishwasher. It is approximately 26 inches long and 2 inches wide. The tub trim is found on the exterior of the dishwasher, and the main reason you would want to replace it is if it is cracked, worn, or damaged. This tub trim is sold individually and is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
jeff from FORT COLLINS, CO
leaking from somewhere around tub
the actual gasket tub seal was easy, 10 minutes. The trim tub gaskets were a pain because I had to uninstall the dishwasher (not plumbing or electrical) then pull it out from the cabinet, remove old trim and re-install. Re-leveled dishwasher, screwed into side of cabinets but it still leaks. Can't figure out where but after replacing all the trim and gaskets its very frustrating.

replace outer cover & handle
It is a very difficult project due to the fact I am still waiting for the 3rd part needed to complete a 10 minute panel replacement. If you are a contractor do NOT give your client a completion date based upon this website information. Showing parts available, until you place your order and pay your money. You then get an email from Part Select advising you one of the parts really isn't available. You call about a week later and are told the part will be in there warehouse by the 18. You call the 19th and are told the part will be in by the 23rd. God only knows if I'll ever get the part needed (a white door handle). Buyer be ware.

Replaced black front w/ stainless steel
The only appliance that wasn't SS was my $900 dishwasher that was tiled-in when my kitchen floors were done...I can only replace it by removing the granite counter. I ordered the SS front and handle to update the look of the 4 year old DW and it was a really good idea. * screws later and it was done. The 'repair' took 15-20 minutes and the results are amazing. BTW...the parts took less than 2 business days to arrive...

Admiral Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit - White Wheels, Left and Right Sides
★★★★★
★★★★★
699 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10065979
Manufacturer Part Number W10712395
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Installation Instructions
Richard from OAKLAND, CA
Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Admiral Dishwasher Rack Track Stop
★★★★★
★★★★★
140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS8260087
Manufacturer Part Number W10518394
This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

Admiral Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Admiral Dishwasher GASKET

15 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16221222
Manufacturer Part Number W11498831
This door gasket is a genuine OEM replacement part that is specially designed for your dishwasher. The gasket is located around the frame of the dishwasher. It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.

My filters had completely clogged up with hard deposits and food left on the dishes after running the dishwasher.
My filters had completely clogged up and had not cleaned my filters at all which was a no-no.I had lots of food left on the dishes after running my dishwasher, so I took bothp filters out and replaced them no tools required. I won’t be using powdered or liquid detergent for my dishwasher anymore only pods and promise to clean my filters once a month, so hopefully that’ll help keep them clean. Very easy replacement even for an old woman.

If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Richard from OAKLAND, CA
Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

PartSelect Number PS16221222
Manufacturer Part Number W11498831
This door gasket is a genuine OEM replacement part that is specially designed for your dishwasher. The gasket is located around the frame of the dishwasher. It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.

This is a genuine OEM part that comes directly from the manufacturer. To replace the filter, simply turn it counterclockwise to unlock, and then screw in the new filter

My filters had completely clogged up and had not cleaned my filters at all which was a no-no.I had lots of food left on the dishes after running my dishwasher, so I took bothp filters out and replaced them no tools required. I won’t be using powdered or liquid detergent for my dishwasher anymore only pods and promise to clean my filters once a month, so hopefully that’ll help keep them clean.

Manufacturer Part Number W10195416
This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

732 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11748729
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10130695
This door latch (Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly, Door Latch Assembly, Latch Assembly) is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part. This latch measures 5 1/2 inches wide, 4 1/2 inches high, 2 1/2 inches deep, is constructed out of plastic and comes in black. The kit includes the black handle, latch, and 2 switches.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Amana Dishwasher Circulation Pump
★★★★★

7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

Samoil from COOPER CITY, FL
The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes
The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

★★★★★
★★★★★
732 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11748729
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10130695
This door latch (Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly, Door Latch Assembly, Latch Assembly) is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part. This latch measures 5 1/2 inches wide, 4 1/2 inches high, 2 1/2 inches deep, is constructed out of plastic and comes in black. The kit includes the black handle, latch, and 2 switches.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Amana Dishwasher Circulation Pump
★★★★★

7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes
The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

This door gasket is a genuine OEM replacement part that is specially designed for your dishwasher. The gasket is located around the frame of the dishwasher. It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.

PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

This roller is designed for the lower dishrack of your dishwasher. On one side of the roller is a clip that allows it to be attached to the dishrack. The dishrack roller allows you to slide the dishrack in and out of the dishwasher efficiently. If one of the rollers is broken or missing, it can cause the dishrack to become difficult to slide in and out. To replace the roller, simply snap it off the dishrack, and snap the new one into place. This is a genuine OEM part.

PartSelect Number PS8727423
Manufacturer Part Number 00611666
This wheel is a dishwasher rack wheel designed for the upper rack of your appliance. The roller wheel is approximately 1.25 inches in diameters and includes the brushing you need for installation. It simply clips right on to the rack frame. After the wheel are attached to the side of the dishrack and are placed into the slides on either side of the appliance. Dishrack roller wheels allow the upper rack in a dishwasher to glide in and out of the appliance with ease. Due to the fact the roller wheel is made of plastic they tend to wear out after a period of time, also they can break. We do recommend you replace these rack wheels in pairs as they often wear out at the same rate. These wheels are sold individually.

The plastic clip on the roller broke
We let this go for a shameful amount of time before I decided I could probably fix it. The roller broke so you could only pull it out about halfway or it would come off the track. I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.

This lower dishrack keeps dishes stable during the wash cycle and fits specific dishwasher models. It is crafted for durability and easy installation. Always consult your dishwasher’s manual to ensure compatibility and proper placement.
Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

PartSelect Number PS8727471
Manufacturer Part Number 00611981
This part is a replacement tine row clip for your dishwasher. The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.
Installation Instructions
James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Bosch Dishwasher VALVE ACCESS
★★★★★
★★★★★
8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16746057
Manufacturer Part Number 10023852
This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

E:15 error code with Watertap
The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.

In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.

I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.

I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.

Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!

Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.

Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes. Not sure if needed or not.

Good luck!

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

Bosch Dishwasher HANDLE-CAP SHAPED
★★★★★
★★★★★
4 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8729301
Manufacturer Part Number 00628998
This door handle end cap is supplied directly by the manufacturer for use with dishwashers. It is a genuine OEM part that is designed to fit just like the original piece. The end cap is made of highly durable plastic, and it is responsible for securing the end of the handle on the dishwasher door. It protects the handle from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear, which can occur over time. It also contributes to the appearance of the dishwasher by concealing any exposed screws and providing a finished look to the handles. When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.

Bosch Dishwasher Lower Dishrack
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS12730058
Manufacturer Part Number 20000533
This lower dishrack keeps dishes stable during the wash cycle and fits specific dishwasher models. It is crafted for durability and easy installation. Always consult your dishwasher’s manual to ensure compatibility and proper placement.
Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

Bosch Dishwasher Adjustable Tine Row Clip
★★★★★
★★★★★
2 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8727471
Manufacturer Part Number 00611981
This part is a replacement tine row clip for your dishwasher. The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.
Installation Instructions
James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Bosch Dishwasher VALVE ACCESS
★★★★★
★★★★★
8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16746057
Manufacturer Part Number 10023852
This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

E:15 error code with Watertap
The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.

In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.

I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.

I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.

Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!

Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.

Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes. Not sure if needed or not.

Good luck!

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

This OEM upper spray arm is sourced directly from the manufacturer for use in various models of dishwasher. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes that are placed in the top rack. It is located beneath the top rack and consists of several small openings or nozzles through which water is propelled with high pressure.

Water leaking under the dishwasher
I looked under and found that 2 brass nuts that secured the heater element through the base housing of the dishwasher has split down each side of the nut and no longer was tight enough to keep water from leaking around either end of the heater element. I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element. I removed the two nuts and replaced them with the parts I ordered from partselect.com. I then put the appropriate wires back at the end of the heater element and ran the dishwasher to check for leaks. No leaks... it was fixed.

Caloric Dishwasher Hose Clamp
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS11740613
Manufacturer Part Number WP285655
The hose clamp is used to hold the water hose in place which will prevent the hose from leaking water. Sometimes the clamp may lose its ability to latch on, causing a leaking washer. For the installation, you will need a flat head screw driver to replace the clamp and a drill to access the screws to remove the front of the washer. Be careful if you do not have specific clamp pliers as the clamp could fly off. Once the front of the washer has been removed, take a quick look for water damage or any obvious signs of where the leak is coming from. If it is not obvious, run water to test.

Caloric Dishwasher Clamp
PartSelect Number PS11743796
Manufacturer Part Number WP696392
This screw-type clamp, also known as a hose clamp, is made of metal and is used within various models of washers to secure the tub-to-pump hose and tub/drum of the washer. Without this clamp, the hose is vulnerable to leaking and disconnecting from the tub during the wash cycle of the washer, which can present a serious safety hazard for the machine and your home. Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.

A wirre from an underwire bra punctured a hole in tub to pump hose. Water leaked out all over the floor.
I searched the internet for parts because we had just had a repairman out to fix the knocking noise in the washer drum. He found an underwire from a bra there and removed it. That cost about $100.

My husband took apart the bottom panel and showed me what the part looked like and I was able to find it on your website. I was able to order the parts and have my husband repair the washer so I was only without a washer for a week and a half. Thank you.

Caloric Dishwasher Faucet Adapter Coupling
★★★★★
★★★★★
4 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS7321390
Manufacturer Part Number 5304490369
A faucet adapter coupling allows the user to connect their dishwasher to their kitchen faucet, and this coupling acts as a bridge between the faucet and intake hose for its various compatible dishwashers. This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.

Purchased used appliance that needed parts
I purchased a wonderful portable dishwasher at a garage sale for $20. The woman had just redecorated her kitchen and was selling the relatively new portable model. All it needed was a new caster and a faucet adapter. After ordering the parts, they arrived in a couple days, and after less than 5 minutes of installing them I had a ""new"" dishwasher that works like a champ! Thanks for making this so easy!

Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.

A wirre from an underwire bra punctured a hole in tub to pump hose. Water leaked out all over the floor.
I searched the internet for parts because we had just had a repairman out to fix the knocking noise in the washer drum. He found an underwire from a bra there and removed it. That cost about $100.

My husband took apart the bottom panel and showed me what the part looked like and I was able to find it on your website. I was able to order the parts and have my husband repair the washer so I was only without a washer for a week and a half. Thank you.

Caloric Dishwasher Faucet Adapter Coupling
★★★★★
★★★★★
4 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS7321390
Manufacturer Part Number 5304490369
A faucet adapter coupling allows the user to connect their dishwasher to their kitchen faucet, and this coupling acts as a bridge between the faucet and intake hose for its various compatible dishwashers. This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.

Purchased used appliance that needed parts
I purchased a wonderful portable dishwasher at a garage sale for $20. The woman had just redecorated her kitchen and was selling the relatively new portable model. All it needed was a new caster and a faucet adapter. After ordering the parts, they arrived in a couple days, and after less than 5 minutes of installing them I had a ""new"" dishwasher that works like a champ! Thanks for making this so easy!

Caloric Dishwasher Element Grommet
PartSelect Number PS451462
Manufacturer Part Number 5300806833
This grommet is used in a number of household appliances. Most often it is used in the dishwasher as part of the assembly that mounts and holds the heating element in place. This replacement part is made out of rubber, which helps create a seal between the element and the appliance. This grommet is sold individually. If you are replacing the heating element, or the brass nut that holds it in place, we recommend you replace the grommet at the same time. Before you begin any repair work on your dishwasher, make sure you have unplugged it and shut off the water supply.

Water leaking under the dishwasher
I looked under and found that 2 brass nuts that secured the heater element through the base housing of the dishwasher has split down each side of the nut and no longer was tight enough to keep water from leaking around either end of the heater element. I powered down the dishwasher at the circuit breaker and then reached under the dishwasher and pulled away the 2 wires that were attached to each side of the heater element. I removed the two nuts and replaced them with the parts I ordered from partselect.com. I then put the appropriate wires back at the end of the heater element and ran the dishwasher to check for leaks. No leaks... it was fixed.

Caloric Dishwasher Hose Clamp
★★★★★
★★★★★
2 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11740613
Manufacturer Part Number WP285655
The hose clamp is used to hold the water hose in place which will prevent the hose from leaking water. Sometimes the clamp may lose its ability to latch on, causing a leaking washer. For the installation, you will need a flat head screw driver to replace the clamp and a drill to access the screws to remove the front of the washer. Be careful if you do not have specific clamp pliers as the clamp could fly off. Once the front of the washer has been removed, take a quick look for water damage or any obvious signs of where the leak is coming from. If it is not obvious, run water to test.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Crosley Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all.

Appliance read out ""err"", would not go on
It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch. Looked on line and found the mail switch to go on was in the latch. I took it apart, 6 screws, wiggled the switch and it went on. So I found the door switch to be bad. It was very simple to change the switch.

Crosley Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Crosley Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Crosley Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Crosley Dishwasher Door Handle And Latch Assembly with Switch
★★★★★
★★★★★
732 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11748729
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10130695
This door latch (Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly, Door Latch Assembly, Latch Assembly) is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part. This latch measures 5 1/2 inches wide, 4 1/2 inches high, 2 1/2 inches deep, is constructed out of plastic and comes in black. The kit includes the black handle, latch, and 2 switches.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

CHRIS from ROANOKE, VA
Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Appliance read out ""err"", would not go on
It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch. Looked on line and found the mail switch to go on was in the latch. I took it apart, 6 screws, wiggled the switch and it went on. So I found the door switch to be bad. It was very simple to change the switch.

Crosley Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Allison from Greenville, SC
Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

Installation Instructions
Ernest from POWELL, WY
Portions of the rack had the coating wear off, exposing the metal, which began to rust.
Removing the old rack was accomplished by removing the grey retainer clips located at the end of the silver rack guides. This allows the entire upper rack to slide out of the guide tracks. Unless you purchased all of the additional parts associated with the rack you must remove the needed old parts such as the spray arm, plate guides, wheel assemblies, etc. to complete the replacement and reassembly. Each of these pieces are ""snapped on"" by clips that are removed with moderate difficulty. Mostly due to the apprehension that you are going to break them, however, with only the pressure exerted by your fingers they will snap off and will go actually go back on easier. The order you remove and replace the various parts is your choice. The exact positioning of the parts back on the new rack is critical, so if your memory is not good, take a quick photo with your cell phone for reference. The only tool I used was a small screwdriver to separate the clip when I first removed the rack, but in retrospect I could have removed it by hand. The key thing to remember is do not apply excess force when trying to remove the old parts, just direct pressure with your fingers. Good luck, it took me only about 15 minutes from start to finish. The best part is I probably saved $150.00 by doing it myself, figuring service time for a repairman, plus his mark-up on the parts.

This part is the replacement wash arm bearing for your dishwasher. It is made of black plastic and is approximately 1 1/4 inches in diameter.

A broken bearing can make the wash arm difficult to rotate, and when this occurs, your dishes may not be washed properly. This part is sold individually and is an authentic OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Ernest from POWELL, WY
Portions of the rack had the coating wear off, exposing the metal, which began to rust.
Removing the old rack was accomplished by removing the grey retainer clips located at the end of the silver rack guides. This allows the entire upper rack to slide out of the guide tracks. Unless you purchased all of the additional parts associated with the rack you must remove the needed old parts such as the spray arm, plate guides, wheel assemblies, etc. to complete the replacement and reassembly. Each of these pieces are ""snapped on"" by clips that are removed with moderate difficulty. Mostly due to the apprehension that you are going to break them, however, with only the pressure exerted by your fingers they will snap off and will go actually go back on easier. The order you remove and replace the various parts is your choice. The exact positioning of the parts back on the new rack is critical, so if your memory is not good, take a quick photo with your cell phone for reference. The only tool I used was a small screwdriver to separate the clip when I first removed the rack, but in retrospect I could have removed it by hand. The key thing to remember is do not apply excess force when trying to remove the old parts, just direct pressure with your fingers. Good luck, it took me only about 15 minutes from start to finish. The best part is I probably saved $150.00 by doing it myself, figuring service time for a repairman, plus his mark-up on the parts.

Preface: I had to remove the dishwasher anyway since I was replacing cabinets. So sitting in the garage it took less than 10 minutes to replace both sides. If I had to do this with dishwasher installed...2 screws pull dishwasher out 6 inches, unhook the spring, unhook the cable, hook new cable, rehook spring. Dido for the other side, slide dishwasher back in place reinstall attachment screws.
All that...max 30 minutes. So easy.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Estate Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

PartSelect Number PS11753379
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Estate Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

Estate Dishwasher Seal
★★★★★
★★★★★
13 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731683
Manufacturer Part Number W10864081
This is a seal, but you may also know it as a door gasket and it is for your dishwasher. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If your dishwasher is leaking you will need to replace the seal, as it is likely damaged. The first step should be to check the seal for buildup of food particles near the sides and the bottom of your appliance.

remove old seal, clean and dry the gap where the new seal will be installed. Apply adhessive, place new seal, then let dry for 24 hrs.

The hardest part was getting the seal, we first ordered from a sears parts store locally. They also told me that everything was included to install it, but they did not include the adhesive, they lost the order via ups and never notified me. I finally called them and they made me go back to the parts store for a refund. I then ordered on parts select and they had it in my hands in 3 days.

Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

113 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8260087
Manufacturer Part Number W10518394
This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

Estate Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Estate Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★

38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Estate Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

Estate Dishwasher Seal

PartSelect Number PS11731683
Manufacturer Part Number W10864081
This is a seal, but you may also know it as a door gasket and it is for your dishwasher. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If your dishwasher is leaking you will need to replace the seal, as it is likely damaged. The first step should be to check the seal for buildup of food particles near the sides and the bottom of your appliance.

remove old seal, clean and dry the gap where the new seal will be installed. Apply adhessive, place new seal, then let dry for 24 hrs.

The hardest part was getting the seal, we first ordered from a sears parts store locally. They also told me that everything was included to install it, but they did not include the adhesive, they lost the order via ups and never notified me. I finally called them and they made me go back to the parts store for a refund. I then ordered on parts select and they had it in my hands in 3 days.

The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

Estate Dishwasher Rack Track Stop

PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch. Looked on line and found the mail switch to go on was in the latch. I took it apart, 6 screws, wiggled the switch and it went on. So I found the door switch to be bad. It was very simple to change the switch.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Scott from Flowood, MS
Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Tub Gasket - Gray
★★★★★
★★★★★
50 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

It would sometimes work, which led me to believe it was a switch. Looked on line and found the mail switch to go on was in the latch. I took it apart, 6 screws, wiggled the switch and it went on. So I found the door switch to be bad. It was very simple to change the switch.

Frigidaire Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Allison from Greenville, SC
Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

Dale from Worley, ID
spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.
Installation Instructions
James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

General Electric Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Spray arm had become unattached and burned by the heat element
It was a simple as: attach and done!
There is a ring on the part that tightens clockwise to the nipple that sprays out the water that it rests on. Twist clockwise and you are done!
It is a mystery how it was unattached to begin with but not a problem in the end, it was easy to fix!

Gasket at the bottom of the door disintegrated.
Took off the kickplate, diconnected the wires and removed the whole door by lifting straight up, removing spring wires from hinges. Once door is disconnected from the machine, removed one hinge by removing bolt. Slid gasket into place, secured hinge back in place, then reconnected wires at bottom, replaced hinge spring wires and slid door back down onto hinges. Now that we know how to do it, could do it in 15 min to half hour.

Brian from MANSFIELD, MA
Dishwasher was randomly beeping when not in use. Then eventually the display wouldn’t light up.
I first tested for 120volts to my dishwasher to verify it was getting power from my electrical panel. Then tested pins 2 and 5 on the control board to make sure there was 14 volts going to the user interface harness. After I verified that I knew it was the user interface that was bad. I watched a video I found on YouTube and followed it. This repair was fairly easy while watching the video and making sure that you use the correct pin out that comes in the box for your model. I’m not an appliance repair person and it took me about an hour start to finish. I’m going to attach the video I https://youtu.be/TI8cUjy5YOE

1. Turn off breaker supplying power to dishwasher in electrical panel
2. Open dishwasher door
3. Unscrew the screws that secure the dishwasher to the counter.
4. Tip dishwasher forward. Identify the non-functioning door latch. It looks exactly like the replacement. Unclip the wire harness from the door latch.
5. On the inside of the dishwasher, there are 2 screws directly under the door latch. Unscrew them and carefully set aside.
6. Remove old door latch.
7. Set new door latch in place. Holding securely, replace screws removed in step 5. Toward the end they get a little tougher to screw in.
8. Plug wire harness into new door latch.
9. Re-align dishwasher and re-secure to counter in previous position.
10. Test latch to make sure it closes properly.
11. Turn on breaker in electrical panel.

Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage.

General Electric Dishwasher Tub Gasket
★★★★★

34 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11774412
Manufacturer Part Number WD08X23476
The tub gasket, also known as the door gasket runs along the perimeter of your dishwasher basin and creates a seal that prevents water from leaking out when the tub is full. If you notice water on the floor after you run your dishwasher, it may be an indication that the gasket is loose or damaged. If your door gasket is damaged, it will need to be replaced. To replace the gasket, simply pull the old gasket out of the groove it rests in, and press the new gasket into place. This part is made of black rubber and is sold individually.

Mohammad from WOODBRIDGE, VA
Water was leaking from the bottom of the door during wash cycle
I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

General Electric Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Spray arm had become unattached and burned by the heat element
It was a simple as: attach and done!
There is a ring on the part that tightens clockwise to the nipple that sprays out the water that it rests on. Twist clockwise and you are done!
It is a mystery how it was unattached to begin with but not a problem in the end, it was easy to fix!

Gasket at the bottom of the door disintegrated.
Took off the kickplate, diconnected the wires and removed the whole door by lifting straight up, removing spring wires from hinges. Once door is disconnected from the machine, removed one hinge by removing bolt. Slid gasket into place, secured hinge back in place, then reconnected wires at bottom, replaced hinge spring wires and slid door back down onto hinges. Now that we know how to do it, could do it in 15 min to half hour.

Brian from MANSFIELD, MA
Dishwasher was randomly beeping when not in use. Then eventually the display wouldn’t light up.
I first tested for 120volts to my dishwasher to verify it was getting power from my electrical panel. Then tested pins 2 and 5 on the control board to make sure there was 14 volts going to the user interface harness. After I verified that I knew it was the user interface that was bad. I watched a video I found on YouTube and followed it. This repair was fairly easy while watching the video and making sure that you use the correct pin out that comes in the box for your model. I’m not an appliance repair person and it took me about an hour start to finish. I’m going to attach the video I https://youtu.be/TI8cUjy5YOE

The tub gasket, also known as the door gasket runs along the perimeter of your dishwasher basin and creates a seal that prevents water from leaking out when the tub is full. If you notice water on the floor after you run your dishwasher, it may be an indication that the gasket is loose or damaged. If your door gasket is damaged, it will need to be replaced. To replace the gasket, simply pull the old gasket out of the groove it rests in, and press the new gasket into place. This part is made of black rubber and is sold individually.

Mohammad from WOODBRIDGE, VA
Water was leaking from the bottom of the door during wash cycle
I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime.

You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

Gibson Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Gibson Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Haier Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33498
This OEM mid spray or center wash arm assembly distributes water and detergent in your dishwasher during the wash cycle. It has small nozzles that spray water onto your dishes and is located between the lower and upper rack. A broken assembly will result in weak water flow and ineffective dishwashing. It may also display signs of damage such as cracks, breaks, or missing nozzles. Additionally, a malfunctioning assembly can cause imbalanced water flow, potentially leading to damage to other dishwasher components such as filters or pumps. Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage. To install this to your appliance, you will need to snap its mounting bracket onto the rack before attaching the arms onto it. This replacement part is sold individually.

Haier Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Haier Dishwasher MID SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
12 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137080
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33498
This OEM mid spray or center wash arm assembly distributes water and detergent in your dishwasher during the wash cycle. It has small nozzles that spray water onto your dishes and is located between the lower and upper rack. A broken assembly will result in weak water flow and ineffective dishwashing. It may also display signs of damage such as cracks, breaks, or missing nozzles. Additionally, a malfunctioning assembly can cause imbalanced water flow, potentially leading to damage to other dishwasher components such as filters or pumps. Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage. To install this to your appliance, you will need to snap its mounting bracket onto the rack before attaching the arms onto it. This replacement part is sold individually.

This part is the replacement carrier roller for your dishwasher. It is also known as the wheel support. It is made of gray plastic and is approximately 5 inches by 2 inches. The carrier roller supports the wheels on your upper dish rack so it can slide in and out of the dishwasher efficiently.

Because it is made of plastic, the roller can occasionally crack and break, and when this occurs, it will need to be replaced. If you notice that your dish rack is having difficulty sliding in and out, you should check to see if the roller is damaged. This is an OEM part from the manufacturer and it is sold individually.

leaking from somewhere around tub
the actual gasket tub seal was easy, 10 minutes. The trim tub gaskets were a pain because I had to uninstall the dishwasher (not plumbing or electrical) then pull it out from the cabinet, remove old trim and re-install. Re-leveled dishwasher, screwed into side of cabinets but it still leaks. Can't figure out where but after replacing all the trim and gaskets its very frustrating.

Took off the kickplate, diconnected the wires and removed the whole door by lifting straight up, removing spring wires from hinges. Once door is disconnected from the machine, removed one hinge by removing bolt. Slid gasket into place, secured hinge back in place, then reconnected wires at bottom, replaced hinge spring wires and slid door back down onto hinges. Now that we know how to do it, could do it in 15 min to half hour.

Mohammad from WOODBRIDGE, VA
Water was leaking from the bottom of the door during wash cycle
I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

This lower rack wheel kit includes 8 wheels and 8 axles that allow the lower dishwasher rack to slide in and out smoothly. If your dishwasher door will not close, is noisy when operating, or the dishes are not cleaning properly, you might need to replace one or more of the wheels. Each wheel and axle are made of plastic, and fit into one another so they can be clipped on to the lower dishwasher rack. Many of our customers found this repair to be quick and easy, and the only tool you should need to complete the repair is a pair of pliers.

Hotpoint Dishwasher RACK SLIDE END CAP
★★★★★

58 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2370502
Manufacturer Part Number WD12X10304
The Rack Slide End Cap is a white one-inch plastic part which replaces the end cap for your dishwasher rack, preventing your rack from sliding too far. If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.

Hotpoint Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM
★★★★★
★★★★★
35 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS17137081
Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499
This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Spray arm had become unattached and burned by the heat element
It was a simple as: attach and done!
There is a ring on the part that tightens clockwise to the nipple that sprays out the water that it rests on. Twist clockwise and you are done!
It is a mystery how it was unattached to begin with but not a problem in the end, it was easy to fix!

I replaced the tub gasket around the door circumference which took less than five minutes to replace. However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front. After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success. So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame.

PartSelect Number PS11726733
Manufacturer Part Number WD35X21038
This lower rack wheel kit includes 8 wheels and 8 axles that allow the lower dishwasher rack to slide in and out smoothly. If your dishwasher door will not close, is noisy when operating, or the dishes are not cleaning properly, you might need to replace one or more of the wheels. Each wheel and axle are made of plastic, and fit into one another so they can be clipped on to the lower dishwasher rack. Many of our customers found this repair to be quick and easy, and the only tool you should need to complete the repair is a pair of pliers.

Lower rack wheel was melted
Unsnapped clip,and moved it 90 degrees. Slip wheel and clip off. Installed clip on new wheel. replaced new wheel. The wheel did not come with a new clip and was not suggested on the parts list. The existing clip was still OK but if it was not, I would have had to order a clip and wait. All in all, a good experience.

Hotpoint Dishwasher RACK SLIDE END CAP
★★★★★
★★★★★
58 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS2370502
Manufacturer Part Number WD12X10304
The Rack Slide End Cap is a white one-inch plastic part which replaces the end cap for your dishwasher rack, preventing your rack from sliding too far. If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward.

Inglis Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

This filter works with the water pump in your dishwasher. It prevents debris from entering the pump and causing damage.

My filters had completely clogged up and had not cleaned my filters at all which was a no-no.I had lots of food left on the dishes after running my dishwasher, so I took bothp filters out and replaced them no tools required. I won’t be using powdered or liquid detergent for my dishwasher anymore only pods and promise to clean my filters once a month, so hopefully that’ll help keep them clean. Very easy replacement even for an old woman.

Inglis Dishwasher Drain Pump
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS11753379
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Inglis Dishwasher Drain Pump
★★★★★
★★★★★
62 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11753379
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Inglis Dishwasher Rack Track Stop
★★★★★
★★★★★
140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

Inglis Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Inglis Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

This filter works with the water pump in your dishwasher. It prevents debris from entering the pump and causing damage. As a result, the filter can occasionally become clogged or damaged, and will need to be replaced. A good indication of a damaged filter is if your dishwasher is not draining or cleaning the dishes properly. This filter has a gray plastic top and bottom that are approximately 5 inches in diameter. This is a genuine OEM part that comes directly from the manufacturer. To replace the filter, simply turn it counterclockwise to unlock, and then screw in the new filter

My filters had completely clogged up and had not cleaned my filters at all which was a no-no.I had lots of food left on the dishes after running my dishwasher, so I took bothp filters out and replaced them no tools required. I won’t be using powdered or liquid detergent for my dishwasher anymore only pods and promise to clean my filters once a month, so hopefully that’ll help keep them clean. Very easy replacement even for an old woman.

This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install.

These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

At around 3 inches in length, the clip is used to keep the tine row in place in the dishrack. If your clip is cracked or damaged, it is best to replace this part. To repair, first lift the release tab and hold the other side to prevent it from falling off. After lifting it off, you can set the new clip on the tine row and lock it up. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution. This repair was rated as very easy by our customers and should be done in 15 minutes or less.

Jenn-Air Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

★★★★★
★★★★★
140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily.

Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Jenn-Air Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip

PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Jenn-Air Dishwasher Tine Pivot
★★★★★
★★★★★
32 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11748190
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10082853
The tine pivot clip, also known as the tine row pivot, is used in dishwashers and is located in the upper dishrack. At around 3 inches in length, the clip is used to keep the tine row in place in the dishrack. If your clip is cracked or damaged, it is best to replace this part. To repair, first lift the release tab and hold the other side to prevent it from falling off. After lifting it off, you can set the new clip on the tine row and lock it up. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution. This repair was rated as very easy by our customers and should be done in 15 minutes or less.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!! Will use this sight again if repairs are needed.

Jenn-Air Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Kelvinator Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Kelvinator Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Kelvinator Dishwasher Drain Pump -120V 60Hz
★★★★★

17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

Kelvinator Dishwasher Drain Hose

PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

I rolled out the old bottom dish rack and rolled in the new one with no problems. In fact, the new bottom dish rack is much better that the original that came from the factory. It only took about less than one minute.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping..

Kelvinator Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Kelvinator Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

★★★★★

699 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10065979
Manufacturer Part Number W10712395
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs.

Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

Kenmore Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Kenmore Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly
★★★★★
★★★★★
142 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Kenmore Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Kenmore Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit - White Wheels, Left and Right Sides
★★★★★
★★★★★
699 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10065979
Manufacturer Part Number W10712395
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Installation Instructions
Richard from OAKLAND, CA
Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

★★★★★
★★★★★
140 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Kenmore Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!!

Kenmore Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Scott from Flowood, MS
Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)

KitchenAid Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

PartSelect Number PS11748190
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10082853
The tine pivot clip, also known as the tine row pivot, is used in dishwashers and is located in the upper dishrack. At around 3 inches in length, the clip is used to keep the tine row in place in the dishrack. If your clip is cracked or damaged, it is best to replace this part. To repair, first lift the release tab and hold the other side to prevent it from falling off. After lifting it off, you can set the new clip on the tine row and lock it up. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution. This repair was rated as very easy by our customers and should be done in 15 minutes or less.

PartSelect Number PS10065979

This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install.

Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

The rack adjuster can break from material fatigue or prolonged high temperature exposure. High temperature exposure can compromise the integrity of the materials. If the rack adjuster breaks, your upper rack may fall down, may be unlevel, or the door may not close. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)

Installation Instructions
Paul from Encinitas, CA
Replace rack adjusters - wheel were broken
Replacement was pretty easy after figuring out how to unsnap/unlock the old pieces. Tools only used to do a little prying and poking, but really aren't needed. Everything either snaps or slides together. Piece of cake

KitchenAid Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★
★★★★★
90 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!! Will use this sight again if repairs are needed.

PartSelect Number PS12075858
Manufacturer Part Number 4581DD3003C
The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in. Make sure the dishwasher is off before starting this installation project.

Dishwasher door became heavy and would fall to the floor if you didn't hold it up.
Removed mounting screws from sides of disher. Removed broken piece of connector assy still attached to hinge. Attached new connector assy to hinge then looped it around pulley with spring attached to opposite end. Need both hands to pull spring up to side of tub and connect it. I would suggest replacing both connector assemblies while you have the dishwasher pulled out. Push dishwasher back in and mount with screws.

Gregory L from INDEPENDENCE, OH
Broken door spring allows the door to overextend to the floor if not propped.
Simple, removed screws securing machine in the cabinet, then pull the unit out of the cabinet space about 10 inches. Springs are accessible within this extension. You need strong hands to extend the springs and attach them. Once attached, push machine back in place and re-install the anchor screws. In my situation, only one spring was broken, so the attached side revealed the correct slot to place the hook on the top position, the bottom position has a plastic lead for the spring, and that lead is attached to a rope to the door hinge. Note: Replace BOTH springs, even if only one is broken.

Dishwasher leaking; got AE error almost every other wash
The inside gasket deteriorates over time - However replacement is easy. the main thing you have to remember is after you remove the old gasket, install the new one starting at the middle top of the tub and work your way down both sides. Also, don't push the gasket all the way in...only enough to hold in place. When you close the door the gasket will form a better seal around the door.

Dishwasher gave the Ne code
When I turned the dishwasher over I discovered the PS3579323 diverter motor had failed due to a leak around the PS3536016 valve, check. No use replacing the diverter motor without fixing the leak so I turned the machine back over and disassembled the spray arms and top of the pump cover which reveled the case assy and the valve, check. Upon removal of the valve, check I discovered hair wrapped around it which compromised the MO31 packing and caused the leak. I probably could have just cleaned out the hair and reassembled it but because my installation is a bit of a pain I elected to change the case assy (because of a slight depression where the packing sets) the M031 packing, the MO25 valve, check, and the MO35 pump gasket. After that was accomplished I turned the machine upside down and replaced the MO26 diverter motor and reinstalled the dishwasher. End result: Ne code cleared, no leaks and now the dishes are clean on the top shelf and the wife is happy. There are great instruction videos on YouTube. Good luck!

End result: Ne code cleared, no leaks and now the dishes are clean on the top shelf and the wife is happy. There are great instruction videos on YouTube. Good luck!

LG Dishwasher ROLLER ASSEMBLY
★★★★★
★★★★★
1 Review
PartSelect Number PS12075858
Manufacturer Part Number 4581DD3003C
The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in. Make sure the dishwasher is off before starting this installation project.
Installation Instructions
Lenny from KIRTLAND, OH
Second roller in on the left side was missing don't ask my how, pulling the bottom rack out the rack would dip down i had to lift it up to pull it the rest of the way out.
Ordered the roller from Parts Select, slid the roller over the little spindle sticking out of the bottom rack and snapped it in place. Job done in less than one minute.

Dishwasher door became heavy and would fall to the floor if you didn't hold it up.
Removed mounting screws from sides of disher. Removed broken piece of connector assy still attached to hinge. Attached new connector assy to hinge then looped it around pulley with spring attached to opposite end. Need both hands to pull spring up to side of tub and connect it. I would suggest replacing both connector assemblies while you have the dishwasher pulled out. Push dishwasher back in and mount with screws.

Installation Instructions
Gregory L from INDEPENDENCE, OH
Broken door spring allows the door to overextend to the floor if not propped.
Simple, removed screws securing machine in the cabinet, then pull the unit out of the cabinet space about 10 inches. Springs are accessible within this extension. You need strong hands to extend the springs and attach them. Once attached, push machine back in place and re-install the anchor screws. In my situation, only one spring was broken, so the attached side revealed the correct slot to place the hook on the top position, the bottom position has a plastic lead for the spring, and that lead is attached to a rope to the door hinge. Note: Replace BOTH springs, even if only one is broken.

Manufacturer Part Number AGB73093001
This nozzle assembly, commonly referred to as a sprayer head or spray arm, is an authentic replacement part supplied directly by LG for use in LG dishwashers. The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes and utensils inside the dishwasher using a series of nozzles that release pressure water. Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.

Bruce from Katy, TX
Dishwasher leaking; got AE error almost every other wash
The inside gasket deteriorates over time - However replacement is easy. the main thing you have to remember is after you remove the old gasket, install the new one starting at the middle top of the tub and work your way down both sides. Also, don't push the gasket all the way in...only enough to hold in place. When you close the door the gasket will form a better seal around the door.

LG Dishwasher Dishrack Assembly
★★★★★

3 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12075784
Manufacturer Part Number 3751DD1001J
This is the lower dishrack assembly for various models of LG dishwashers. This dishrack is an OEM part that is designed to hold dishes and cutlery during the wash cycle of the dishwasher. This dishrack is made of a coated metal to prevent rusting, cracking, and peeling. However, over time and through further exposure to hot temperatures from the heating element, the coated material of the dishwasher rack can begin to peel, at which time it needs replacing. This dishrack comes as an individual part and does not come with any other parts or accessories, such as its accompanying cutlery basket.

Glen from LINESVILLE, PA
Dishwasher gave the Ne code
When I turned the dishwasher over I discovered the PS3579323 diverter motor had failed due to a leak around the PS3536016 valve, check. No use replacing the diverter motor without fixing the leak so I turned the machine back over and disassembled the spray arms and top of the pump cover which reveled the case assy and the valve, check. Upon removal of the valve, check I discovered hair wrapped around it which compromised the MO31 packing and caused the leak. I probably could have just cleaned out the hair and reassembled it but because my installation is a bit of a pain I elected to change the case assy (because of a slight depression where the packing sets) the M031 packing, the MO25 valve, check, and the MO35 pump gasket. After that was accomplished I turned the machine upside down and replaced the MO26 diverter motor and reinstalled the dishwasher. End result: Ne code cleared, no leaks and now the dishes are clean on the top shelf and the wife is happy. There are great instruction videos on YouTube. Good luck!

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part.

To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly
★★★★★
★★★★★
135 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731673
Manufacturer Part Number W10862259
This replacement part is a door latch assembly for a dishwasher. The latch keeps the appliance door closed while it is running, and prohibits the dishwasher from starting when the door is open. Depending on your model, you will need to remove approximately eleven screws to remove the inner panel and access the latch assembly. The latch assembly is connected by two wiring harnesses that are nearly identical, so it is recommended to make note of where each harness goes before continuing with the repair. You will need a Torx screwdriver to complete the repair. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source before beginning this repair.

Turned off power to dishwasher, my electrical panel is clearly marked with switch for dishwasher. No guess work there.
3 min. to remove old assy. 3 min. to replace with new part.
I might add that I am a 67yr. old female. So if I can handle this repair, anyone can.

Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

Magic Chef Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly
★★★★★

135 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731673
Manufacturer Part Number W10862259
This replacement part is a door latch assembly for a dishwasher. The latch keeps the appliance door closed while it is running, and prohibits the dishwasher from starting when the door is open. Depending on your model, you will need to remove approximately eleven screws to remove the inner panel and access the latch assembly. The latch assembly is connected by two wiring harnesses that are nearly identical, so it is recommended to make note of where each harness goes before continuing with the repair. You will need a Torx screwdriver to complete the repair. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source before beginning this repair.

I had to force the door open, due to a broken handle/latch.
Ordered assembly with help of order desk to assure correct part number. Arrived within 3 to 4 days. Not sure but very fast. Only had to wash dishes by hand once.
Turned off power to dishwasher, my electrical panel is clearly marked with switch for dishwasher. No guess work there.
3 min. to remove old assy. 3 min. to replace with new part.
I might add that I am a 67yr. old female. So if I can handle this repair, anyone can.

Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

PartSelect Number PS11756150
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10546503
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as ""easy"" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution.

PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

391 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS3406971
Manufacturer Part Number W10195416
This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

151 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11756150
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10546503
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as ""easy"" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part.

Walter from Tucson, AZ
Broken latch handle
The hardest thing was figuring out that you only need to purchase the latch handle because it only comes as a complete latch assembly, why they even list the latch assembly as a separate part in the parts list stupid. (you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit.

Maytag Dishwasher Circulation Pump
★★★★★

7 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16744934
Manufacturer Part Number W11612326
This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

The dish washer wasn’t cleaning dishes
The circulation pump is a super easy fix and the installation video parts select has on its website is accurate. I felt the most difficult part of the repair was removing the dishwasher from the kitchen counter to make the repairs. After you get the dishwasher out, you pretty much just pop the old pump out with your hands and a flat head screwdriver. (The supplied video is spot on ) Installing the new pump will require a pinch plier or a hose clamp. I chose a new hose clamp as it is cheaper and I would never use the pinch pliers after this job.

Tim from Ringgold, GA
Water dripping from right corner of door
Took out about 7 torx screws to remove the inner door liner. Discovered evidence of leak coming from the sop dispenser latch, and noticed the grommet had turned soft and was torn. The grommet is only about 1"" square. Used nut driver to remove two screws to remove latch assembly. Slipped old grommet off and put new one on, and reattached the latch. The foam seal at the bottom of the door looked worn, so we replaced it with weatherstripping from home improvement store. The main door seal was brittle, so we replaced it too - just grab an end and pull the old one out. The new one was installed by starting at one end and we just pushed it in place. We used a nut-driver to push it in - we were afraid a screwdriver might damage it. The new door seal required us to latch the door to get it to stay closed the fist couple of days, but now it has loosened up a bit and works as expected. And NO MORE LEAKS. Cost is much less than a new unit!

This genuine inner door foam insulation strip, sometimes known as bottom seal foam, is used to create a waterproof seal that helps prevent leaking from the door area of the dishwasher.

Be sure to remove all residue and clean surrounding areas of the dishwasher build. It is strongly recommended to check other sealant parts on the dishwasher door such as the door gasket and dispenser grommet to ensure the leaking issue is fully solved.

Water Leak at right side bottom of the dishwasher door
After dissassembling the unit to discover the leakage source I determined that it would do best to replace the top three contributors to the problem as listed by you. Disassembly, parts replacement and reassembly was straight forward and a few hints garnered from your good instructions and assembly blow-up drawings made the job simple with the most difficult task being the removal of the adhesive foam gasket at the bottom of the door's interior. After scraping as much of the deteriorated foam away as possible with a plastic scraper I used some of my wife's nail polisher remover and a clean-up rag (being careful not to get the remover on plastic parts)and soon I had the adhesion area surface clean and ready to receive the new seal. With close attention to clean up of residues left behind from detergent and water and care taken with part installation and reassembly it no longer leaks and I hope to get another 10-15 years of leak free operation out of the dishwasher

The door spring puts tension on the dishwasher door though the hinge. This keeps it from falling or dropping abruptly when opening and closing. Please note: The spring for either side of the door is sold individually. If you see that your dishwasher is leaking, the door will not close or open properly, or it gets stuck, then replacing the spring could be a solution to these symptoms. During installation, remember there is potential for the door spring to snap if it is under too much pressure. For safety precautions, make sure you unplug the dishwasher from the power source before beginning your project.

Norge Dishwasher Hose Clamp
★★★★★

2 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11740613
Manufacturer Part Number WP285655
The hose clamp is used to hold the water hose in place which will prevent the hose from leaking water. Sometimes the clamp may lose its ability to latch on, causing a leaking washer. For the installation, you will need a flat head screw driver to replace the clamp and a drill to access the screws to remove the front of the washer. Be careful if you do not have specific clamp pliers as the clamp could fly off. Once the front of the washer has been removed, take a quick look for water damage or any obvious signs of where the leak is coming from. If it is not obvious, run water to test.

Water dripping from right corner of door
Took out about 7 torx screws to remove the inner door liner. Discovered evidence of leak coming from the sop dispenser latch, and noticed the grommet had turned soft and was torn. The grommet is only about 1"" square. Used nut driver to remove two screws to remove latch assembly. Slipped old grommet off and put new one on, and reattached the latch. The foam seal at the bottom of the door looked worn, so we replaced it with weatherstripping from home improvement store. The main door seal was brittle, so we replaced it too - just grab an end and pull the old one out. The new one was installed by starting at one end and we just pushed it in place. We used a nut-driver to push it in - we were afraid a screwdriver might damage it. The new door seal required us to latch the door to get it to stay closed the fist couple of days, but now it has loosened up a bit and works as expected. And NO MORE LEAKS. Cost is much less than a new unit!

PartSelect Number PS11748543
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10117748
This genuine inner door foam insulation strip, sometimes known as bottom seal foam, is used to create a waterproof seal that helps prevent leaking from the door area of the dishwasher. The existing insulation strip may leave a sticky residue or leftover disintegrated strip that must be scraped off before installing the new strip. Residue can be scraped off with a putty knife. Be sure to remove all residue and clean surrounding areas of the dishwasher build. It is strongly recommended to check other sealant parts on the dishwasher door such as the door gasket and dispenser grommet to ensure the leaking issue is fully solved.

Water Leak at right side bottom of the dishwasher door
After dissassembling the unit to discover the leakage source I determined that it would do best to replace the top three contributors to the problem as listed by you. Disassembly, parts replacement and reassembly was straight forward and a few hints garnered from your good instructions and assembly blow-up drawings made the job simple with the most difficult task being the removal of the adhesive foam gasket at the bottom of the door's interior. After scraping as much of the deteriorated foam away as possible with a plastic scraper I used some of my wife's nail polisher remover and a clean-up rag (being careful not to get the remover on plastic parts)and soon I had the adhesion area surface clean and ready to receive the new seal. With close attention to clean up of residues left behind from detergent and water and care taken with part installation and reassembly it no longer leaks and I hope to get another 10-15 years of leak free operation out of the dishwasher

The door spring puts tension on the dishwasher door though the hinge. This keeps it from falling or dropping abruptly when opening and closing. Please note: The spring for either side of the door is sold individually. If you see that your dishwasher is leaking, the door will not close or open properly, or it gets stuck, then replacing the spring could be a solution to these symptoms. During installation, remember there is potential for the door spring to snap if it is under too much pressure. For safety precautions, make sure you unplug the dishwasher from the power source before beginning your project.

PartSelect Number PS11740613
Manufacturer Part Number WP285655
The hose clamp is used to hold the water hose in place which will prevent the hose from leaking water. Sometimes the clamp may lose its ability to latch on, causing a leaking washer. For the installation, you will need a flat head screw driver to replace the clamp and a drill to access the screws to remove the front of the washer. Be careful if you do not have specific clamp pliers as the clamp could fly off. Once the front of the washer has been removed, take a quick look for water damage or any obvious signs of where the leak is coming from. If it is not obvious, run water to test.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS8260087
Manufacturer Part Number W10518394
This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers.

Roper Dishwasher Mounting Bracket

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Roper Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★

38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Roper Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

PartSelect Number PS11731683
Manufacturer Part Number W10864081
This is a seal, but you may also know it as a door gasket and it is for your dishwasher. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If your dishwasher is leaking you will need to replace the seal, as it is likely damaged. The first step should be to check the seal for buildup of food particles near the sides and the bottom of your appliance.

remove old seal, clean and dry the gap where the new seal will be installed. Apply adhessive, place new seal, then let dry for 24 hrs.

The hardest part was getting the seal, we first ordered from a sears parts store locally. They also told me that everything was included to install it, but they did not include the adhesive, they lost the order via ups and never notified me. I finally called them and they made me go back to the parts store for a refund. I then ordered on parts select and they had it in my hands in 3 days.

Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

Roper Dishwasher Mounting Bracket
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11745496
Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145
The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.

Roper Dishwasher Rack Adjuster
★★★★★
★★★★★
38 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750255
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10204131
This OEM dishrack roller and adjuster is found in your dishwasher. They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.

Replacement of broken Rack Assembly Mount with Wheel
The only piece that may be a little difficult to remove here without a tool is the 'Track Stop'. This piece has a couple of clip-like pieces that need to be depressed in order to remove it. A flathead screw driver will do the trick. Once this piece is out and you have popped the Mount off of the Rack, you simply roll the piece out of the track, roll the new one in and snap the new Mount in place, replacing the Track Stop when you are done. VERY EASY!

Roper Dishwasher Drain Pump
★★★★★

62 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11753379
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10348269
This drain pump is used in dishwashers to remove water from the dishwasher tub. If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.

Andrew from Alexandria, VA
dishwasher not draining after wash cycle
Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.

First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.

Roper Dishwasher Door Gasket with Strike - Black
★★★★★
★★★★★
65 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS5136129
Manufacturer Part Number W10542314
This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.

Roper Dishwasher Seal
★★★★★
★★★★★
13 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11731683
Manufacturer Part Number W10864081
This is a seal, but you may also know it as a door gasket and it is for your dishwasher. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If your dishwasher is leaking you will need to replace the seal, as it is likely damaged. The first step should be to check the seal for buildup of food particles near the sides and the bottom of your appliance.

Noelle from Tucker, GA
dishwasher leaking
remove old seal, clean and dry the gap where the new seal will be installed. Apply adhessive, place new seal, then let dry for 24 hrs.

The hardest part was getting the seal, we first ordered from a sears parts store locally. They also told me that everything was included to install it, but they did not include the adhesive, they lost the order via ups and never notified me. I finally called them and they made me go back to the parts store for a refund. I then ordered on parts select and they had it in my hands in 3 days.

PAUL from ESTES PARK, CO
Unit Wouldn't Work. ""Clean"" Light Blinking
The unit had power, but the controls would not work. The ""clean"" light was blinking. I first replaced the control unit, no help. I then used the ""just ask"" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat. I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the ""hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry"" buttons. That did it. Easy parts to locate and replace. It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts.

This door latch, used in dishwashers, is located at the top of the door and locks the door shut when the dishwasher is working.

Next, access the latch and pull wires from the switches. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions and guidance. Remember to unplug the dishwasher from the power source or shut off the house circuit breaker before beginning this installation project.

Installation Instructions
Dennis from Austin, TX
Latch handle broke due to Latch Assembly worn
This repair was fairly quick and easy. The parts are much better made than the stock Maytag. The parts from PartSelect came lightening quick! Never used before, always Sears, but will ALWAYS use from now on!
So, first, make super sure all power is disconnected. Then take the torx and remove all the screws on interior front cover - the top center two actually hold the latch assembly and handle. Once all are removed, I propped the cover up and left all wiring connected. I removed the switches connected to the old latch assembly and just removed the new switches from the new latch assembly, and popped the old ones onto the new latch assembly. Now have new switches if the old ones ever wear out.
The latch assembly just pops out from what should be two sets of plastic peg clips molded into the black control panel back. Mine were busted on one side. So I molded some jb weld on the remaining sides to the pegs on the latch assembly and then screwed all back together (the controls on the panel are fine, not spending $85 if I can get away with sticking it...and the upper center two screws do the most of the holding anyway).
Works great again. I really am ultra impressed with the HUGE difference in reinforcement that the new handle has. If Maytag would have built it that way to begin with, should not have broke. Anyway, if you are here just checking to see if you can do and how much parts are, place the order - it is no problem and cheap, and will probably never give up and break again.

Samsung Dishwasher Door Latch with Switches - NO Handle
★★★★★
★★★★★
22 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11751688
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10275768
This door latch, used in dishwashers, is located at the top of the door and locks the door shut when the dishwasher is working. If the door will not close or is damaged, changing the latch could be the solution. For this repair, remove all screws from the inner panel, then lift up the inner door panel and hold the door apart. Next, access the latch and pull wires from the switches. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions and guidance. Remember to unplug the dishwasher from the power source or shut off the house circuit breaker before beginning this installation project.

Installation Instructions
Dennis from Austin, TX
Latch handle broke due to Latch Assembly worn
This repair was fairly quick and easy. The parts are much better made than the stock Maytag. The parts from PartSelect came lightening quick! Never used before, always Sears, but will ALWAYS use from now on!
So, first, make super sure all power is disconnected. Then take the torx and remove all the screws on interior front cover - the top center two actually hold the latch assembly and handle. Once all are removed, I propped the cover up and left all wiring connected. I removed the switches connected to the old latch assembly and just removed the new switches from the new latch assembly, and popped the old ones onto the new latch assembly. Now have new switches if the old ones ever wear out.
The latch assembly just pops out from what should be two sets of plastic peg clips molded into the black control panel back. Mine were busted on one side. So I molded some jb weld on the remaining sides to the pegs on the latch assembly and then screwed all back together (the controls on the panel are fine, not spending $85 if I can get away with sticking it...and the upper center two screws do the most of the holding anyway).
Works great again. I really am ultra impressed with the HUGE difference in reinforcement that the new handle has. If Maytag would have built it that way to begin with, should not have broke. Anyway, if you are here just checking to see if you can do and how much parts are, place the order - it is no problem and cheap, and will probably never give up and break again.

Samsung Dishwasher Door Guide Cap
PartSelect Number PS12721288
Manufacturer Part Number DD67-00113B
This dishwasher door cap guide is a genuine OEM replacement designed for Samsung WaterWall dishwashers. The door cap guide serves an aesthetic purpose by hiding mounting screws or other hardware on the dishwasher cabinet. It also protects the hardware from moisture, debris, or hard impacts. It is normal for the cap to become damaged or worn down over time due to normal mechanical stress, aging, or accidents. Over time the cap may crack or break, the adhesive backing may wear down or the cover may be unable to stay securely in place. You will need to replace the door cap or the mounting hardware on the exterior panel will be exposed. Simply pull off the faulty cap and snap the new one into place.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Multi Rib Belt
★★★★★
★★★★★
105 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742271
Manufacturer Part Number WP40111201
This dryer drum drive belt attaches to the motor pully and works the drum as the motor rotates. The belt has a length of 93- 3/6 inches, and wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pully. Replacing the rib belt could solve symptoms such as a screeching noise when the dryer tumbles, a broken belt (dryer will not tumble if its broken), no heat or not enough heat, or the dryer will not start. The tools needed for this repair are a nut driver and a putty knife. Remember to unplug the dryer before installing the part and protect your hands by wearing gloves.

Speed Queen Dishwasher M Series New Style Coil Kit
★★★★★
★★★★★
155 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS334310
Manufacturer Part Number 279834
When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil

Installation Instructions
Michael from Kirkwood, MO
Gas Dryer would not ignite
1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.
2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.
3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.
4. removed two wires and screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.
5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.
6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.
7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.
8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.
9. Carefully and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on.
10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out.
11.Replaced the black vent plastic.
12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.
13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite.
14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure.
15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!

Speed Queen Dishwasher Drum Support Roller
★★★★★
★★★★★
14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11741913
Manufacturer Part Number WP37001042
This drum support roller is used for square-ported model clothes dryers. This part is sold individually; however, rollers tend to wear at the same rate, so it is suggested that both should be replaced at the same time. It has a metallic bearing in its center. The drum support roller holds the drum in place while it rotates on the support wheels. You may have a faulty or damaged roller if your dryer will not start or tumble, takes too long to dry clothes, or starts making loud noises. Customers have ranked this repair as easy and should take 15-30 minutes to complete.

Drum not centered , clothes getting stuck in dryer
The first thing I did was to unplug the dryer from the wall. Then I removed the bottom two screws and slid the bottom cover off so i could see all the way to the back, I tipped the dryer back against the wall and searched for the problem with a flashlight. I noticed that one of the guide wheels that held the drum in place was sheared off. I took the new drum support roller out and carefully slid it over the shaft, I had to jiggle it around for a bit, but then it finally was seated correctly. I replaced the washer and then the clip using a pair of needle nose pliers and a regular screw driver and then turned the dryer by hand to see if the wheel came off. After confirming that it worked, I put the cover back on, and plugged it in and tested it.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Dryer Radiant Flame Sensor
★★★★★
★★★★★
12 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11741429
Manufacturer Part Number WP338906
If your gas dryer is not heating up or igniting, then replacing the flame sensor, located in the burner assembly, could solve it. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.

Installation Instructions

Gas Dryer would not ignite
1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.
2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.
3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.
4. removed two wires and screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.
5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.
6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.
7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.
8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.
9. Carefully and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on.
10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out.
11.Replaced the black vent plastic.
12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.
13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite.
14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure.
15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!

Loud banging sound. Worn out roller.
Pulled off the lower panel with 5/16 socket.Pulled off the door assembly by removing the two screws at the bottom of the door assembly. I pulled down a little and then out. be carefull of the wires. Other posts said to remove. The wires were long enough I did not have to remove them. I just leaned it against the wall. I then removed the 4 screws that hold the front piece in.pulled it off replaced brackets , installed self adhesive felt(stuck good) and then glides. Mine were thin but not the problem. I then reached under the drum and released the belt from the tensioner. I then pulled the whole drum out.This is the time to vacum out good. I could get to the rear rollers very easy. The left roller was shot and the shaft half wore into(the problem). I pulled off the two screws holding the roller support. Normally You have to remove the wheel with snap ring pliers first to remove the support. In this case snap ring long gone. Replaced support shaft, installed thrust washers and roller with grease for both sides. The right support shaft was still good. Removed tensioner pulley and inspected. It was just as good as the new one. Cleaned and greased and reinstalled. Put new belt on the tub and slid it back in. Be carefull to get the belt on the proper side of the tensioner. I then installed the front supprt in place to support the tub with the 4 screws. Spun the tub(felt good) then reached under and reinstalled belt to motor and tensioner. Spun again to check for belt alignment. (Check) Reinstalled door an lower panel. Test Quiet Sounds like new. Very easy! I hope this helps someone just as the other post has helped me. Blessings to all.

Wasn't the belt!! Changed it anyway. Should have come here earlier. That mistake added several days to the repair waiting for a second batch of the right parts. Became a pro at taking the dryer apart and reassembling, though! Easy job, just take your time and mark your wires, if you need to.
Followed other people's excellent instructions. Clean out all the dust bunnies. Schematics were a great resource. Those and the prices made me a repeat customer.
The shaft of the Idler Lever wheel was the cause, but decided, since I had it apart, to spend a little more money and replace both Drum Support Rollers and the Roller Bracket and Shaft Assembly. They showed some wear, and the parts were very inexpensive. Make sure you have snap ring pliers with prongs that are smaller than the standard 0.40 to save some aggravation with the Drum Rollers. $5 tool. Total parts were less than $60. Probably saved $150+ in labor. Quieter than ever now. Thanks!

Speed Queen Dishwasher Thrust Washer
★★★★★
★★★★★
2 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11740482
Manufacturer Part Number WP233520
This genuine OEM washer has a 3/4 inch outside diameter. This thrust washer can be used on most makes and models of dryers. A complete list of compatible dryers is available below. The washer is found on dryers around the drum support rollers and idler pulleys, and helps prevent the rollers and pulleys from bumping up against the brackets they are installed on. Your thrust washer could be defective if you notice your dryer wont tumble, rotate, or turn; or there is a load squealing or whining noise when the dryer tumbles. The repair is a relatively easy job. You will require a putty knife, 5/16 inch nut driver, and E-Ring pliers. Remember to disconnect the power to your dryer before you begin the repair.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Idler Pulley Wheel with Bearing
★★★★★
★★★★★
21 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757553
Manufacturer Part Number WPY54414
The idler pulley wheel helps the belt to rotate the drum in your dryer. If your dryer will not start, will not tumble, or is noisy during operation, the idler pulley wheel may need to be replaced. This part is located beneath the drum of the dryer, so the drum will need to be removed before you can access the idler pulley wheel. It is also recommended to remove the blower housing and motor from the dryer itself, for easier access to the idler pulley wheel. It is connected by a set of two 5/16 screws. This two-inch-wide idler pulley wheel is beige or black in color and is made of plastic. This pulley wheel comes with its own metallic bearing in its center. Be sure to shut off power to the dryer before beginning this repair.

Squeeling/Screeching
First I read all of the other stories about this problem so I would have the correct parts. At $6 a roller, decided to get all 3 & a belt. Pulled the lower panel off (2 bolts), then the door (2 bolts). Marked the door switch wires. Took 2 bolts out of the top & tilted it back. I found this the easiest way to access the drum. Mark 2 wires before disconnecting them from the top. All bolts are 5/16"". Removed the plastic piece that connects the lint trap to the blower (3 screws). Have to access these from inside the drum. Removed the belt, then the drum. The bad roller was the belt tension roller. Can't get to the snap ring from the front of the dryer for this roller. The 2 rollers in the back you can get to without removing the drum completely. Very easy to replace all rollers with the drum out. Also very easy to re-assemble. Buy or borrow a good set of snap ring pliers. Make sure you diagram the proper belt route if you don't have a picture. I printed a picture off this web site. Have someone hold the drum up so you can get the belt on, otherwise the entire repair is a 1 person job. Went back together in about 10 minutes. Total cost $40.00 parts & shipping.

This dryer drum glide pad is an inch long. It is made of a felt material and is used for gas and electric clothes dryers. The dryer drum glide provides a soft surface for the front of the drum glide and allows the drum to move effortlessly. If you notice that your dryer is making loud squeaking noises, it might be due to the drum glide pad being worn down or torn apart. Make sure to unplug your dryer before performing this repair. To access this part, you will need to open up the top of the dryer. The front panel and the bulk head will also need to come off.

105 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742271
Manufacturer Part Number WP40111201
This dryer drum drive belt attaches to the motor pully and works the drum as the motor rotates. The belt has a length of 93- 3/6 inches, and wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pully. Replacing the rib belt could solve symptoms such as a screeching noise when the dryer tumbles, a broken belt (dryer will not tumble if its broken), no heat or not enough heat, or the dryer will not start. The tools needed for this repair are a nut driver and a putty knife. Remember to unplug the dryer before installing the part and protect your hands by wearing gloves.

Speed Queen Dishwasher M Series New Style Coil Kit
★★★★★
★★★★★
155 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS334310
Manufacturer Part Number 279834
When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil

Speed Queen Dishwasher Drum Support Roller
★★★★★

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11741913
Manufacturer Part Number WP37001042
This drum support roller is used for square-ported model clothes dryers. This part is sold individually; however, rollers tend to wear at the same rate, so it is suggested that both should be replaced at the same time. It has a metallic bearing in its center. The drum support roller holds the drum in place while it rotates on the support wheels. You may have a faulty or damaged roller if your dryer will not start or tumble, takes too long to dry clothes, or starts making loud noises. Customers have ranked this repair as easy and should take 15-30 minutes to complete.

I then reached under the drum and released the belt from the tensioner. I then pulled the whole drum out.This is the time to vacum out good. I could get to the rear rollers very easy. The left roller was shot and the shaft half wore into(the problem). I pulled off the two screws holding the roller support. Normally You have to remove the wheel with snap ring pliers first to remove the support. In this case snap ring long gone. Replaced support shaft, installed thrust washers and roller with grease for both sides. The right support shaft was still good. Removed tensioner pulley and inspected. It was just as good as the new one. Cleaned and greased and reinstalled. Put new belt on the tub and slid it back in. Be carefull to get the belt on the proper side of the tensioner. I then installed the front supprt in place to support the tub with the 4 screws. Spun the tub(felt good) then reached under and reinstalled belt to motor and tensioner. Spun again to check for belt alignment. (Check) Reinstalled door an lower panel. Test Quiet Sounds like new. Very easy! I hope this helps someone just as the other post has helped me. Blessings to all.

Wasn't the belt!! Changed it anyway. Should have come here earlier. That mistake added several days to the repair waiting for a second batch of the right parts. Became a pro at taking the dryer apart and reassembling, though! Easy job, just take your time and mark your wires, if you need to.
Followed other people's excellent instructions. Clean out all the dust bunnies. Schematics were a great resource. Those and the prices made me a repeat customer.
The shaft of the Idler Lever wheel was the cause, but decided, since I had it apart, to spend a little more money and replace both Drum Support Rollers and the Roller Bracket and Shaft Assembly. They showed some wear, and the parts were very inexpensive. Make sure you have snap ring pliers with prongs that are smaller than the standard 0.40 to save some aggravation with the Drum Rollers. $5 tool. Total parts were less than $60. Probably saved $150+ in labor. Quieter than ever now. Thanks!

Drum not centered , clothes getting stuck in dryer
The first thing I did was to unplug the dryer from the wall. Then I removed the bottom two screws and slid the bottom cover off so i could see all the way to the back, I tipped the dryer back against the wall and searched for the problem with a flashlight. I noticed that one of the guide wheels that held the drum in place was sheared off. I took the new drum support roller out and carefully slid it over the shaft, I had to jiggle it around for a bit, but then it finally was seated correctly. I replaced the washer and then the clip using a pair of needle nose pliers and a regular screw driver and then turned the dryer by hand to see if the wheel came off. After confirming that it worked, I put the cover back on, and plugged it in and tested it.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Idler Pulley Wheel with Bearing
★★★★★
★★★★★
21 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11757553
Manufacturer Part Number WPY54414
The idler pulley wheel helps the belt to rotate the drum in your dryer. If your dryer will not start, will not tumble, or is noisy during operation, the idler pulley wheel may need to be replaced. This part is located beneath the drum of the dryer, so the drum will need to be removed before you can access the idler pulley wheel. It is also recommended to remove the blower housing and motor from the dryer itself, for easier access to the idler pulley wheel. It is connected by a set of two 5/16 screws. This two-inch-wide idler pulley wheel is beige or black in color and is made of plastic. This pulley wheel comes with its own metallic bearing in its center. Be sure to shut off power to the dryer before beginning this repair.

First I read all of the other stories about this problem so I would have the correct parts. At $6 a roller, decided to get all 3 & a belt. Pulled the lower panel off (2 bolts), then the door (2 bolts). Marked the door switch wires. Took 2 bolts out of the top & tilted it back. I found this the easiest way to access the drum. Mark 2 wires before disconnecting them from the top. All bolts are 5/16"". Removed the plastic piece that connects the lint trap to the blower (3 screws). Have to access these from inside the drum. Removed the belt, then the drum. The bad roller was the belt tension roller. Can't get to the snap ring from the front of the dryer for this roller. The 2 rollers in the back you can get to without removing the drum completely. Very easy to replace all rollers with the drum out. Also very easy to re-assemble. Buy or borrow a good set of snap ring pliers. Make sure you diagram the proper belt route if you don't have a picture. I printed a picture off this web site. Have someone hold the drum up so you can get the belt on, otherwise the entire repair is a 1 person job. Went back together in about 10 minutes. Total cost $40.00 parts & shipping.

Manufacturer Part Number WP500121
This dryer drum glide pad is an inch long. It is made of a felt material and is used for gas and electric clothes dryers. The dryer drum glide provides a soft surface for the front of the drum glide and allows the drum to move effortlessly. If you notice that your dryer is making loud squeaking noises, it might be due to the drum glide pad being worn down or torn apart. Make sure to unplug your dryer before performing this repair. To access this part, you will need to open up the top of the dryer. The front panel and the bulk head will also need to come off.

The belt has a length of 93- 3/6 inches, and wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pully. Replacing the rib belt could solve symptoms such as a screeching noise when the dryer tumbles, a broken belt (dryer will not tumble if its broken), no heat or not enough heat, or the dryer will not start. The tools needed for this repair are a nut driver and a putty knife. Remember to unplug the dryer before installing the part and protect your hands by wearing gloves.

Speed Queen Dishwasher M Series New Style Coil Kit
★★★★★
★★★★★
155 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS334310
Manufacturer Part Number 279834
When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil

Gas Dryer would not ignite
1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.
2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.
3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.
4. removed two wires and screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.
5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.
6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.
7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.
8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.
9. Carefully and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on.
10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out.
11.Replaced the black vent plastic.
12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.
13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite.
14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure.
15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!

Speed Queen Dishwasher Drum Support Roller
★★★★★

14 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11741913
Manufacturer Part Number WP37001042
This drum support roller is used for square-ported model clothes dryers. This part is sold individually; however, rollers tend to wear at the same rate, so it is suggested that both should be replaced at the same time. It has a metallic bearing in its center. The drum support roller holds the drum in place while it rotates on the support wheels. You may have a faulty or damaged roller if your dryer will not start or tumble, takes too long to dry clothes, or starts making loud noises. Customers have ranked this repair as easy and should take 15-30 minutes to complete.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Dryer Radiant Flame Sensor

PartSelect Number PS11741429
Manufacturer Part Number WP338906
If your gas dryer is not heating up or igniting, then replacing the flame sensor, located in the burner assembly, could solve it. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.

Speed Queen Dishwasher Single Drum Glide Felt Pad
★★★★★
★★★★★
3 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11742773
Manufacturer Part Number WP500121
This dryer drum glide pad is an inch long. It is made of a felt material and is used for gas and electric clothes dryers. The dryer drum glide provides a soft surface for the front of the drum glide and allows the drum to move effortlessly. If you notice that your dryer is making loud squeaking noises, it might be due to the drum glide pad being worn down or torn apart. Make sure to unplug your dryer before performing this repair. To access this part, you will need to open up the top of the dryer. The front panel and the bulk head will also need to come off.

Squeeling and grinding noise
Wasn't the belt!! Changed it anyway. Should have come here earlier. That mistake added several days to the repair waiting for a second batch of the right parts. Became a pro at taking the dryer apart and reassembling, though! Easy job, just take your time and mark your wires, if you need to.
Followed other people's excellent instructions. Clean out all the dust bunnies. Schematics were a great resource. Those and the prices made me a repeat customer.
The shaft of the Idler Lever wheel was the cause, but decided, since I had it apart, to spend a little more money and replace both Drum Support Rollers and the Roller Bracket and Shaft Assembly. They showed some wear, and the parts were very inexpensive. Make sure you have snap ring pliers with prongs that are smaller than the standard 0.40 to save some aggravation with the Drum Rollers. $5 tool. Total parts were less than $60. Probably saved $150+ in labor. Quieter than ever now. Thanks!

Tappan Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Tappan Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Tappan Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm

This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle.

If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

It was amazing, the items were shipped within days of placing the order. They arrived ready for installation. My husband had the new racks in place in 10 minutes. He removed the wheels from the old racks and placed the wheel on the new racks which required no tools. Then we slid the new racks into place, a perfect fit!

Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Tappan Dishwasher Drain Hose
★★★★★

25 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping..

Tappan Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Tappan Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all.

Tappan Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

This wheel is a dishwasher rack wheel designed for the upper rack of your appliance. The roller wheel is approximately 1.25 inches in diameters and includes the brushing you need for installation. It simply clips right on to the rack frame. After the wheel are attached to the side of the dishrack and are placed into the slides on either side of the appliance. Dishrack roller wheels allow the upper rack in a dishwasher to glide in and out of the appliance with ease. Due to the fact the roller wheel is made of plastic they tend to wear out after a period of time, also they can break. We do recommend you replace these rack wheels in pairs as they often wear out at the same rate. These wheels are sold individually.

The plastic clip on the roller broke
We let this go for a shameful amount of time before I decided I could probably fix it. The roller broke so you could only pull it out about halfway or it would come off the track. I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

This part is a replacement tine row clip for your dishwasher. The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.

James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Thermador Dishwasher VALVE ACCESS
★★★★★
★★★★★
8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16746057
Manufacturer Part Number 10023852
This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

E:15 error code with Watertap
The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.

In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.

I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.

I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.

Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!

Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.

Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes. Not sure if needed or not.

Good luck!

Bosch mounting bracket install
Hello,
I received the parts 12/10/23. Thank you for your prompt shipping. It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.

I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section). In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually.

However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it. It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.

Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states. In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

28 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8727387
Manufacturer Part Number 00611475
This is a replacement dishrack roller or wheel for your dishwasher. It is made of gray plastic, measures a little over an inch in diameter, and is sold individually. This roller is designed for the lower dishrack of your dishwasher. On one side of the roller is a clip that allows it to be attached to the dishrack. The dishrack roller allows you to slide the dishrack in and out of the dishwasher efficiently. If one of the rollers is broken or missing, it can cause the dishrack to become difficult to slide in and out. To replace the roller, simply snap it off the dishrack, and snap the new one into place. This is a genuine OEM part.

PartSelect Number PS8727423
Manufacturer Part Number 00611666
This wheel is a dishwasher rack wheel designed for the upper rack of your appliance. The roller wheel is approximately 1.25 inches in diameters and includes the brushing you need for installation. It simply clips right on to the rack frame. After the wheel are attached to the side of the dishrack and are placed into the slides on either side of the appliance. Dishrack roller wheels allow the upper rack in a dishwasher to glide in and out of the appliance with ease. Due to the fact the roller wheel is made of plastic they tend to wear out after a period of time, also they can break. We do recommend you replace these rack wheels in pairs as they often wear out at the same rate. These wheels are sold individually.

The plastic clip on the roller broke
We let this go for a shameful amount of time before I decided I could probably fix it. The roller broke so you could only pull it out about halfway or it would come off the track. I looked up the part, and bought it. Actually bought two in case it happened again. When I arrived I looked at how it was put together on the other side and then just basically pushed it onto the rod and it was fixed. I am ashamed it took so long to do it. Never be afraid to try it yourself. It was a total of $10 shipped to fix it.

Thermador Dishwasher Lower Dishrack

8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12730058
Manufacturer Part Number 20000533
This lower dishrack keeps dishes stable during the wash cycle and fits specific dishwasher models. It is crafted for durability and easy installation. Always consult your dishwasher’s manual to ensure compatibility and proper placement.
Installation Instructions
Patricia from DALLAS, TX
A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.
The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit.

The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one. The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one.

This part is a replacement tine row clip for your dishwasher. The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.
Installation Instructions
James from SHENANDOAH, TX
Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.
Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines.

Thermador Dishwasher VALVE ACCESS
★★★★★
★★★★★
8 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS16746057
Manufacturer Part Number 10023852
This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

E:15 error code with Watertap
The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.

In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.

I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.

I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.

Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!

Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.

Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes. Not sure if needed or not.

I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable. As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package. Please advise next steps.

PartSelect Number PS8737036
Manufacturer Part Number 00745856
This OEM upper spray arm is sourced directly from the manufacturer for use in various models of dishwasher. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes that are placed in the top rack. It is located beneath the top rack and consists of several small openings or nozzles through which water is propelled with high pressure. When the dishwasher is in running, water is pumped through the spray arm, and the force of the water causes it to rotate, ensuring that water is distributed evenly across the dishes for effective cleaning. If the arm become damaged or clogged with debris, you may notice difficulties cleaning your dishes properly, rattling or scraping sounds and reduced overall efficiency.

Uni Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Drain hose was missing
My friend bought a used dishwasher at a garage sale, the previous owner had thrown away the drain hose because it was ""nasty"" they said....remember it could have been cleaned. When I went to install it, I removed the old washer, and discovered that the old hose would not fit on the replacement dishwasher. I went to the local repair shop, armed with the model and serial #'s. they searched and searched their books and could not find the hose part number. they said ""good luck"" when I left...I went home and looked up the model on your web site, ordered the hose, and in 3 days had the dishwasher installed and running in about 30 minutes...thanks for prompt shipping.. I couldn't believe it arrived so soon...Mowerman

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Uni Dishwasher Drain Hose
★★★★★

PartSelect Number PS9494138
Manufacturer Part Number 807117001
If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.

Uni Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Uni Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Water leaking from Inlet Valve
Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Uni Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Whirlpool Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★

90 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

PartSelect Number PS10065979
Manufacturer Part Number W10712395
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install.

In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (""Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?""). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!! Will use this sight again if repairs are needed.

Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.

★★★★★
★★★★★
1081 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS10064063
Manufacturer Part Number W10712394

Replace rack adjusters - wheel were broken

Whirlpool Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip
★★★★★

90 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS11750071
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher.

On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★

206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

Remove the bottom cover plate. Disconnect the water inlet and black rubber hose. Remove 2 mounting screws. Pull out electrical connector. Reverse order. Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Allison from Greenville, SC
Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Drain Pump -120V 60Hz

17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

Be sure to get the brass inlet connector really tight so it won't leak. I did the final tightning after the part is mounted. Not a bad repair at all. The only problem was that it leaked in the first place and messed up my subfloor and laminate flooring.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★

84 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12705424
Manufacturer Part Number 5304518927
This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.

Melted spray arm resulted in leaky dishwasher
Over Thanksgiving, the spray arm in my dishwasher apparently popped off and was partially melted. I remounted it inside the dishwasher, but the new hole was on the side of the arm. I think this resulted in water being sprayed directly against the door and not up through the top holes. It flooded my kitchen floor.

The spray arm pops on and off with plastic tabs (?) at the base. You can lightly pry with a butter knife or simply wiggle it off. The new one popped right on. Easiest repair EVER.

spray arm fell off and melted on element
The Spray arm and the support had come off during operation and subsequently melted on the heating element. This was our fault, as a knife had slipped through the lower dish-rack and acted as a ramp to launch the spray arm as it came around. The support was a simple 1/4 turn counter-clockwise until it clicked into place, drop the strainer basket into position around the support, them push the spray arm into place until the catches snap over the retaining ring molded into the support. All told, about 10 minutes, max.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Drain Pump -120V 60Hz
★★★★★
★★★★★
17 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS8689824
Manufacturer Part Number A00126401
This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm
★★★★★
★★★★★
143 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Westinghouse Dishwasher Bottom Door Gasket
★★★★★
★★★★★
206 Reviews
PartSelect Number PS9495545
Manufacturer Part Number 809006501
This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.

Scott from Flowood, MS
Bottom Door Seal fell apart and started leaking.
First I opened the door all the way. Second I reached down to the bottom gasket then grabed it on the right end of the seal that is on the right side of the door. Then I pulled the end outward from the bottom of the door toward the heater coil in the bottom of the washer. It came out real easy. You see it just snaps into a little plastic groove under the door. I then cleaned up the area for food and soap particules. I then placed the new gasket in place by lining up the notch toward the right end with the piece of plastic that encloses the right end of the plastic notch on the bottom right end of the door. Then push it in untill it stops going into the notch. It snaps in but does not make a snaping sound. It just won't go in no more.

PartSelect Number PS8260227
Manufacturer Part Number 154827601
This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73"" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.

Hello Victor, Thank you for the question. We suggest first checking the water pressure to the appliance. You can also check the valve. The ports where the fill hose connects can become blocked with build up and not allow water to flow through. We hope this helps.

Dishwasher will fill with water. Not wash and then drain water within 5 minutes. It never sprays.
For model number WDT750SAHZ0
Hello Charles and thank you for writing. You should try a hard reset first. Go to your breaker box, turn the breaker for your unit off, wait 5 minutes and turn the breaker back on. If this does not fix this problem then your unit might need to be leveled with kit PS972325 also you need to check the door latch PS11756967 as it might be faulty and possibly needs to be replaced. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.

Gasket on soap dispenser came out of sliding cover. Is this needed for proper operation? I would think that it is needed because it is factory installed. Is there a way to replace/reinstall gasket?
For model number WDT750SAHZ0
Hello, Thank you for your question. Looking at your model number that seal is important so detergent doesn't leave out. You will need to purchase the whole dispenser assembly- PartSelect Number PS11731570. We hope this helps.

Dishwasher will fill with water. Not wash and then drain water within 5 minutes. It never sprays.
For model number WDT750SAHZ0
Hello Charles and thank you for writing. You should try a hard reset first. Go to your breaker box, turn the breaker for your unit off, wait 5 minutes and turn the breaker back on. If this does not fix this problem then your unit might need to be leveled with kit PS972325 also you need to check the door latch PS11756967 as it might be faulty and possibly needs to be replaced. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.

Gasket on soap dispenser came out of sliding cover. Is this needed for proper operation? I would think that it is needed because it is factory installed. Is there a way to replace/reinstall gasket?
For model number WDT750SAHZ0
Hello, Thank you for your question. Looking at your model number that seal is important so detergent doesn't leave out. You will need to purchase the whole dispenser assembly- PartSelect Number PS11731570. We hope this helps.

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

You can try to reset the appliance by disconnecting power at the breaker for a few mins and restarting. You can also try to Press the ""Start/Cancel"" button to clear the ""PF"" error code.

My Frigidaire dishwasher door opens lower (more than level) and I think the spring or cable may be broken? What do you think? M# FGHD2433KF1 S# TH94647585 How many do I need? What are the part numbers for each? Can you determine the manufacture date of this machine?
For model number FGHD2433KF1
Hello Steve, Thank you for your inquiry. We recommend checking the hinges-which come as a kit, door springs-most models require two and cable friction cables-most models require two. Based on your model and serial number, we show that this model was made in November of 2009. Good luck with your repair.

Keep searches simple. Use keywords, e.g. ""leaking"", ""pump"", ""broken"" or ""fit"".
The spray arm would fall off during the washing cycle.
Repair was simple. I unscrewed the old grommet which held the old spray arm and screwed-on the new one. About 30 seconds was required. Other people having this problem should note that the spray-arm is made of three pieces which are inseparable when the arm is new. The arm is sold in this form. However, when your machine is having th ... Read more

Dish washer starts then stops with pf indicator
For model number FGHD2433KF1
Hello Chuck, Thank you for the question. The Power Failure Error code can indicate a interruption in power. You can try to reset the appliance by disconnecting power at the breaker for a few mins and restarting. You can also try to Press the ""Start/Cancel"" button to clear the ""PF"" error code. We hope this helps!

For model number FGHD2433KF1
Hello Steve, Thank you for your inquiry. We recommend checking the hinges-which come as a kit, door springs-most models require two and cable friction cables-most models require two. Based on your model and serial number, we show that this model was made in November of 2009. Good luck with your repair.

The spray arm would fall off during the washing cycle.
Repair was simple. I unscrewed the old grommet which held the old spray arm and screwed-on the new one. About 30 seconds was required. Other people having this problem should note that the spray-arm is made of three pieces which are inseparable when the arm is new. The arm is sold in this form.

Our dishwasher leaks at both side near the end of cycle under the door ,we changed the door seal but it still leaked ?
For model number WDTA50SAHZ0
Hi Chris, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description that you have provided, we would recommend checking the float switch, part number PS11750031. The dishwasher float switch is actuated by rising water, which will then interrupt power to the inlet valve to prevent the appliance from overfilling. However, the contacts in the switch can short out and not interrupt the voltage to the inlet valve as needed. If the float switch is not faulty, you may need to check the center wash arm assembly, part number PS11755664, and the upper wash arm assembly, part number PS11752935. If the wash arm is cracked, it can allow a jet of water to spray toward the door seal, causing a leak. Remove the wash arm and inspect it for cracks. If the wash arm is cracked, you may need to replace it. If there is no issue with the wash arm assemblies, you may need to check the water inlet valve, part number PS11752927. The water inlet valve opens to allow water to enter the dishwasher. If the water inlet valve is stuck open, the dishwasher will continue to fill with water until it leaks or overflows. If the water inlet valve is not faulty, then you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11738151. We hope this helps!

Water leaking from under the door
For model number WDTA50SAHZ0
Hello Carolyn, thank you for your question. We have researched your model and found that the issue is probably with the door seal, part number PS11731683. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!

Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter.

Our dishwasher leaks at both side near the end of cycle under the door ,we changed the door seal but it still leaked ?
For model number WDTA50SAHZ0
Hi Chris, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description that you have provided, we would recommend checking the float switch, part number PS11750031. The dishwasher float switch is actuated by rising water, which will then interrupt power to the inlet valve to prevent the appliance from overfilling. However, the contacts in the switch can short out and not interrupt the voltage to the inlet valve as needed. If the float switch is not faulty, you may need to check the center wash arm assembly, part number PS11755664, and the upper wash arm assembly, part number PS11752935. If the wash arm is cracked, it can allow a jet of water to spray toward the door seal, causing a leak. Remove the wash arm and inspect it for cracks. If the wash arm is cracked, you may need to replace it. If there is no issue with the wash arm assemblies, you may need to check the water inlet valve, part number PS11752927. The water inlet valve opens to allow water to enter the dishwasher. If the water inlet valve is stuck open, the dishwasher will continue to fill with water until it leaks or overflows. If the water inlet valve is not faulty, then you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11738151. We hope this helps!

Water leaking from under the door
For model number WDTA50SAHZ0
Hello Carolyn, thank you for your question. We have researched your model and found that the issue is probably with the door seal, part number PS11731683. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

We are looking to replace the clip that snaps into the little white wheel on the upper left arm of the upper rack
For model number WDT970SAHZ0
Hello Stephanie, thank you for your question. The Axel is only sold as part of the Rack Adjuster. The rack adjuster kit has been redesigned as the original adjuster was not as stable and was causing issues for customers. The adjuster kit would come with all parts for the right and left side of the upper rack and would be the only parts that would fix the issue you're having. We hope this solves your problem!

I have a dishwasher that was recently affected by a power surge and now the control panel is not working...seems to be crazy. The buttons don´t respond, the equipment initiates without pushing anything, etc. I think the surge affected the control board, but I wanted to know if you sell the component to replace it, and how much it costs. Thanks. Rodrigo

We are looking to replace the clip that snaps into the little white wheel on the upper left arm of the upper rack
For model number WDT970SAHZ0
Hello Stephanie, thank you for your question. The Axel is only sold as part of the Rack Adjuster. The rack adjuster kit has been redesigned as the original adjuster was not as stable and was causing issues for customers. The adjuster kit would come with all parts for the right and left side of the upper rack and would be the only parts that would fix the issue you're having. We hope this solves your problem!

I have a dishwasher that was recently affected by a power surge and now the control panel is not working...seems to be crazy. The buttons don´t respond, the equipment initiates without pushing anything, etc. I think the surge affected the control board, but I wanted to know if you sell the component to replace it, and how much it costs. Thanks. Rodrigo

The rotating arm (that sprays water) under the top drinking glass rack keeps falling off. I reattach it by snapping back in place but it eventually falls off again. I don't know the specific part name to order a new one
For model number LDF7774ST
Hi Ken, thank you for your question. That part would be called your nozzle, part number: PS3527665. You may also need to replace the guide it clips into as well: PS12075961. Good luck with your repair.

The buttons on the select panel only work when the door is about 6 inches away from closed or fully closed. If the door is open any more than this, you cannot select the cycle and no buttons light up.
For model number LDF7774ST
Hello Becky, thank you for your inquiry. We have narrowed the issue down to the following parts: the control panel, part number PS10066436, and the door latch, part number PS5574492. Check both the parts and replace the defective one. We hope this is what you were looking for!

The dishwasher continues to cycle until the door is open or the breaker is turned off. Do you know what part I would order to fix this problem
For model number LDF7774ST
Hello and thank you for writing. Your dishwasher runs on a cycle of cleaning and drying. When the washer will not switch over from one cycle to the next, it may run continuously until you either unplug the unit or open the door of the unit. A dishwasher that continues to cycle may have a bad heating element PS7788065 or control panel PS10066436. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

The rotating arm (that sprays water) under the top drinking glass rack keeps falling off. I reattach it by snapping back in place but it eventually falls off again. I don't know the specific part name to order a new one
For model number LDF7774ST
Hi Ken, thank you for your question. That part would be called your nozzle, part number: PS3527665. You may also need to replace the guide it clips into as well: PS12075961. Good luck with your repair.

The buttons on the select panel only work when the door is about 6 inches away from closed or fully closed. If the door is open any more than this, you cannot select the cycle and no buttons light up.
For model number LDF7774ST
Hello Becky, thank you for your inquiry. We have narrowed the issue down to the following parts: the control panel, part number PS10066436, and the door latch, part number PS5574492. Check both the parts and replace the defective one. We hope this is what you were looking for!

The dishwasher continues to cycle until the door is open or the breaker is turned off. Do you know what part I would order to fix this problem
For model number LDF7774ST
Hello and thank you for writing. Your dishwasher runs on a cycle of cleaning and drying. When the washer will not switch over from one cycle to the next, it may run continuously until you either unplug the unit or open the door of the unit. A dishwasher that continues to cycle may have a bad heating element PS7788065 or control panel PS10066436. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.

The utensil basket was old, bowed and the bottom was falling out.
I ordered a new replacement basket. The new one is a little different but it fits in the same place and takes up the same amount of room in the dishwasher. It looks very nice too.

I read the answer provided above but i have the same issue but the start up button does not light up. I have already replaced the control panel. Any ideas?

Dishwasher won't power on. At one point in the day when it wasn't in use, it flashed and beeped unexpectedly. Then later on, when loaded, wouldn't power on at all. Power connection tested, breaker tested, all fine.

Hello Thomas, Thank you for the question. This normally indicates the Control Boar, PartSelect Number PS11769634 is defective and may need to be replaced. We hope this helps!

I am able to select the cycle i want and the timer displays but when i press the start button, it doesn't go into count down to start the machine.
For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Brian, Thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the latch switches under part PS11756967 for your model. If the start button is lit up but the unit won't start, the latch switches may not be functioning properly. These switches, when activated, tell the unit that its ok to start the wash cycle. If the switches are not the issue, then the control panel would be the next step. We hope this helps.

WHEN I FIRST START THE DISHWASHER IT WHISTLES AND EACH TIME IT CYCLES . THINKING ITS THE WATER VALVE, YOUR THOUGHTS PLEASE.
For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Floyd, thank you for contacting us. Yes, a faulty water inlet valve, part number PS11752927, can cause this issue. The diaphragm inside the inlet valve can deteriorate and deform after years of use. When this happens, the water passing through the valve can produce a loud buzzing, squealing, or whistling sound. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!

January 20, 2023
My dishwasher fills, and heats the water but the pump doesn't run the water just sits in the bottom. I pulled the filters out and disassembled everything I could inside and got a lot of gunk out of it. I took the pump (not drain) motor out to see if something was stuck in the impeller, and I bench tested the motor with 120v and it worked fine. I reassembled everything and turned the power back on and it ran through a cleaning cycle and worked perfectly. Now it does the same thing again, fills, and countdown timer starts but no washing.
For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Brad, thank you for your inquiry. This could be an issue with the (timer) Electronic Control PS11769634 as it does not want seem to complete the washing cycle. We look forward to hearing from you.

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release ... Read more

I am able to select the cycle i want and the timer displays but when i press the start button, it doesn't go into count down to start the machine. I read the answer provided above but i have the same issue but the start up button does not light up. I have already replaced the control panel. Any ideas?
For model number MDB8959SFZ4

Dishwasher won't power on. At one point in the day when it wasn't in use, it flashed and beeped unexpectedly. Then later on, when loaded, wouldn't power on at all. Power connection tested, breaker tested, all fine.

For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Brian, Thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the latch switches under part PS11756967 for your model. If the start button is lit up but the unit won't start, the latch switches may not be functioning properly. These switches, when activated, tell the unit that its ok to start the wash cycle. If the switches are not the issue, then the control panel would be the next step. We hope this helps.

WHEN I FIRST START THE DISHWASHER IT WHISTLES AND EACH TIME IT CYCLES . THINKING ITS THE WATER VALVE, YOUR THOUGHTS PLEASE.
For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Floyd, thank you for contacting us. Yes, a faulty water inlet valve, part number PS11752927, can cause this issue. The diaphragm inside the inlet valve can deteriorate and deform after years of use. When this happens, the water passing through the valve can produce a loud buzzing, squealing, or whistling sound. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!

My dishwasher fills, and heats the water but the pump doesn't run the water just sits in the bottom. I pulled the filters out and disassembled everything I could inside and got a lot of gunk out of it. I took the pump (not drain) motor out to see if something was stuck in the impeller, and I bench tested the motor with 120v and it worked fine. I reassembled everything and turned the power back on and it ran through a cleaning cycle and worked perfectly. Now it does the same thing again, fills, and countdown timer starts but no washing.
For model number MDB8959SFZ4
Hello Brad, thank you for your inquiry. This could be an issue with the (timer) Electronic Control PS11769634 as it does not want seem to complete the washing cycle. We look forward to hearing from you.

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

Frank
November 14, 2022
It’s blinking ER. It did this last week and then started running again. It starts and you hear the pump running, stops again. I turned breaker off to see if that cleared the message but it didn’t work. Any help would be greatly appreciated
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Frank, thank you for contacting us. The error code ER indicates that something is wrong with the keypad. A button might be failing due to steam getting inside. We would recommend accessing the keypad area and checking if all the buttons appear fine. If not we would recommend cleaning the board. If this does not help, there is probably some issue with the control panel, part number PS8760856. We would also recommend running a continuity test on the electronic control board, part number PS12365809. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair.

I get an error code ""uo"" and the machine stops 2 minutes after I start it.
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Jess, thank you for your question! This error means that your drying vent is stuck open. While in the wash cycle, the main control board does not receive a signal from the vent assembly that the vent plunger is closed. Plunger status is sensed with the optical sensors in the vent assembly. Your vent assembly and blower, part number PS12741853, are part of the door itself. We hope this information is useful!

I wish to clean bottom basket and screen. Do I just pull hard on the basket tab?
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Terry, thank you for your question. Remove the bottom rack, and pull up on the lower spray arm. It will simply pop off the holder. The soil trap handle is then turned toward you so the handle is facing you. Lift the soil trap out of the unit. The spray arm holder is still attached so it will have to be removed and reinstalled into the new soil trap. Reverse the steps to reinstall the parts into the dishwasher. I hope this helps!

Trips on false power failure reguardless of wash cycle. Trips on every 5th or 6th wash.
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hi Michael, thank you for reaching out. We would suggest checking the wire harnesses of the main control board. If they are fine, the issue could be with the main control board, part number PS12365809. It manages the functions of the dishwasher, such as washing, draining and drying. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this sorts out your problem!

The spray arm would fall off during the washing cycle.
Repair was simple. I unscrewed the old grommet which held the old spray arm and screwed-on the new one. About 30 seconds was required. Other people having this problem should note that the spray-arm is made of three pieces which are inseparable when the arm is new. The arm is sold in this form. However, when your machine is having th ... Read more

Frank
November 14, 2022
It’s blinking ER. It did this last week and then started running again. It starts and you hear the pump running, stops again. I turned breaker off to see if that cleared the message but it didn’t work. Any help would be greatly appreciated
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Frank, thank you for contacting us. The error code ER indicates that something is wrong with the keypad. A button might be failing due to steam getting inside. We would recommend accessing the keypad area and checking if all the buttons appear fine. If not we would recommend cleaning the board. If this does not help, there is probably some issue with the control panel, part number PS8760856. We would also recommend running a continuity test on the electronic control board, part number PS12365809. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair.

I get an error code ""uo"" and the machine stops 2 minutes after I start it.
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Jess, thank you for your question! This error means that your drying vent is stuck open. While in the wash cycle, the main control board does not receive a signal from the vent assembly that the vent plunger is closed. Plunger status is sensed with the optical sensors in the vent assembly. Your vent assembly and blower, part number PS12741853, are part of the door itself. We hope this information is useful!

February 28, 2020
I wish to clean bottom basket and screen. Do I just pull hard on the basket tab?
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hello Terry, thank you for your question. Remove the bottom rack, and pull up on the lower spray arm. It will simply pop off the holder. The soil trap handle is then turned toward you so the handle is facing you. Lift the soil trap out of the unit. The spray arm holder is still attached so it will have to be removed and reinstalled into the new soil trap. Reverse the steps to reinstall the parts into the dishwasher. I hope this helps!

Trips on false power failure reguardless of wash cycle. Trips on every 5th or 6th wash.
For model number FGHD2465NF1A
Hi Michael, thank you for reaching out. We would suggest checking the wire harnesses of the main control board. If they are fine, the issue could be with the main control board, part number PS12365809. It manages the functions of the dishwasher, such as washing, draining and drying. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this sorts out your problem!

Kent
January 16, 2020
Try to run a load of dishes had run some the night before no problems when i tried to power it up to set it to wash nothing happened. When i jiggled the door something made power come on maybe a loose wire. I start running it a few minutes later it shut down and this time it wouldn’t power back up. When i jiggle the door again thought i saw a little spark at the bottom so i unplugged it and left it.
For model number LDF6920ST
Hi Kent, thank you for your question. It sounds like you may need to replace the door latch/lock: PS3522841. That part will not allow your power to come on if it believes that the door is open in any way. Good luck with your repair.

Just got the error code le while dishwasher was running. Shut off the breaker and restarted the cycle and got the same code. Error code said its either the wiring harness or the motor. It's been much noisier recently so i'm guessing its the motor. Is there any way to tell which it is for sure? Tried to see what a motor would cost and found multiple motors listed. What motor does this code refer to?
For model number LDF6920ST
Hello and thank you for writing. The LE error code on the LG dishwasher display is an indication of a MOTOR ERROR. The 5 issues that may cause this fault code is a wiring problem (the most common reason for LE error), the impeller of the washing pump is locked, the rotor of the washing motor is locked, the blade is locked, or the PCB main control board is faulty. According to our database, the model number you provided is just a portion of a model number with multiple possible variations. To ensure that we recommend parts that will work for your model, please check your information again; you will need to provide us with the full model and serial numbers located on the sticker on the unit itself. Once we have that information, we would be happy to find the part you need. We are looking forward to your reply, please always notate the model number. Thank you.

Door falls open. It no longer soft opens.

January 16, 2020
Try to run a load of dishes had run some the night before no problems when i tried to power it up to set it to wash nothing happened. When i jiggled the door something made power come on maybe a loose wire. I start running it a few minutes later it shut down and this time it wouldn’t power back up. When i jiggle the door again thought i saw a little spark at the bottom so i unplugged it and left it.
For model number LDF6920ST
Hi Kent, thank you for your question. It sounds like you may need to replace the door latch/lock: PS3522841. That part will not allow your power to come on if it believes that the door is open in any way. Good luck with your repair.

Just got the error code le while dishwasher was running. Shut off the breaker and restarted the cycle and got the same code. Error code said its either the wiring harness or the motor. It's been much noisier recently so i'm guessing its the motor. Is there any way to tell which it is for sure? Tried to see what a motor would cost and found multiple motors listed. What motor does this code refer to?
For model number LDF6920ST
Hello and thank you for writing. The LE error code on the LG dishwasher display is an indication of a MOTOR ERROR. The 5 issues that may cause this fault code is a wiring problem (the most common reason for LE error), the impeller of the washing pump is locked, the rotor of the washing motor is locked, the blade is locked, or the PCB main control board is faulty. According to our database, the model number you provided is just a portion of a model number with multiple possible variations. To ensure that we recommend parts that will work for your model, please check your information again; you will need to provide us with the full model and serial numbers located on the sticker on the unit itself. Once we have that information, we would be happy to find the part you need. We are looking forward to your reply, please always notate the model number. Thank you.

For model number LDF6920ST
Hi Dennis, thank you for your question! We have found that you may be facing this issue because of the door latch. The door latch ensures that the dishwasher door latches shut. If the door does not latch properly, the door switch might prevent the dishwasher from running. We would recommend checking the door latch, part number PS3577153, to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!

Does this model have a filter and how do i clean it?
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Renae, thank you for your question. There is a screen under the lower spray arm that can be removed and cleaned. Remove the lower rack and rotate the lower wash arm lock nut counter clockwise to release the arm. Once that is removed the filter screen should be visible and is a half circle piece. If the filter you need to clean is the pump filter that has to be accessed by removing the bottom access panel and locating that part on the pump under the unit. I hope this helps.

I would like to confirm my tentative diagnosis of a non working dishwasher. This is a 3-year old machine. It fills with water, goes through the cycle and drains and dries. But does not circulate the water during the wash cycles. Since this not an old machine, pump should not be worn out. I think it most likely is a switch/ capacitor problem (part no. W10758882) that is not turning the circulating pump (part no. W10772008) on. Is this the problem (low cost fix) or is the pump the problem (high cost fix)? Thank you for your advice.
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Donald, Thank you for your question. Our sources say you would need to replace the pump under part PS11769898 for your model to fix the issue. Hope this helps!

How do I take out the bottom sprayer to check out the check-out-valve?
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hi Patrick, Thank you for your question. To replace the wash arm in your dishwasher, first remove the lower dishrack. Then rotate the lower spray arm lock nut counter-clockwise to remove it from the bottom of the dishwasher. Install the new wash arm by aligning it on the support and then rotate the locking nut clockwise to secure it. Then confirm that the arm can spin freely by spinning it around. Once you have confirmed that it spins correctly, you can reinstall the lower dishrack and close the door. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!

Water is sitting inside at the sump when cycle is complete.
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Bob, thank you for the question. We would recommend checking the drain hose to ensure that it is not clogged. If the issue still occurs, you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11769898, to fix the issue. We hope this helps!

Renae
November 27, 2019
Does this model have a filter and how do i clean it?
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Renae, thank you for your question. There is a screen under the lower spray arm that can be removed and cleaned. Remove the lower rack and rotate the lower wash arm lock nut counter clockwise to release the arm. Once that is removed the filter screen should be visible and is a half circle piece. If the filter you need to clean is the pump filter that has to be accessed by removing the bottom access panel and locating that part on the pump under the unit. I hope this helps.

December 2, 2019
I would like to confirm my tentative diagnosis of a non working dishwasher. This is a 3-year old machine. It fills with water, goes through the cycle and drains and dries. But does not circulate the water during the wash cycles. Since this not an old machine, pump should not be worn out. I think it most likely is a switch/ capacitor problem (part no. W10758882) that is not turning the circulating pump (part no. W10772008) on. Is this the problem (low cost fix) or is the pump the problem (high cost fix)? Thank you for your advice.
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Donald, Thank you for your question. Our sources say you would need to replace the pump under part PS11769898 for your model to fix the issue. Hope this helps!

How do I take out the bottom sprayer to check out the check-out-valve?
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hi Patrick, Thank you for your question. To replace the wash arm in your dishwasher, first remove the lower dishrack. Then rotate the lower spray arm lock nut counter-clockwise to remove it from the bottom of the dishwasher. Install the new wash arm by aligning it on the support and then rotate the locking nut clockwise to secure it. Then confirm that the arm can spin freely by spinning it around. Once you have confirmed that it spins correctly, you can reinstall the lower dishrack and close the door. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!

Water is sitting inside at the sump when cycle is complete.
For model number KDTM354DSS4
Hello Bob, thank you for the question. We would recommend checking the drain hose to ensure that it is not clogged. If the issue still occurs, you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11769898, to fix the issue. We hope this helps!

Other people having this problem should note that the spray-arm is made of three pieces which are inseparable when the arm is new. The arm is sold in this form.

February 26, 2020
Our Whirlpool is not even 18 mos. Old and stopped working. It will start the cycle, fill the tub with water, then just stall. The lights stay on, but nothing happens. There's no blockage with the drain hose, because it drains fine. Thanks in advance!
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hello Jon, thank you for your question. There are a few parts we would reocmmend testing first to determine if they have failed. They are the PartSelect Number PS11743423 Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS8260087 heating element, PartSelect Number: PS11770231 pump and motor and the sensor PartSelect Number PS12070543. If those parts are tested and are fine, the issue would most likely be with the electronic board. I hope this helps.

Even on high heat my dishwasher will not dry dishes at all. Dishes are dripping wet at end of cycle.
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hello Susan, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model you have provided and we would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the heating element, the high limit thermostat, and the door vent. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Also if you don't already use a rinse aid, we would recommend using one to facilitate drying. We hope this helps.

light goes on but will not fill or drain
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hi Michael, thank you for contacting us. We would recommend checking the door latch, part number PS11756967, to fix the issue. It is at the top of the dishwasher door and keeps the door closed when the dishwasher is running. If this is faulty, the dishwasher may not start the cycle. We hope this sorts out your problem!

February 26, 2020
Our Whirlpool is not even 18 mos. Old and stopped working. It will start the cycle, fill the tub with water, then just stall. The lights stay on, but nothing happens. There's no blockage with the drain hose, because it drains fine. Thanks in advance!
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hello Jon, thank you for your question. There are a few parts we would reocmmend testing first to determine if they have failed. They are the PartSelect Number PS11743423 Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS8260087 heating element, PartSelect Number: PS11770231 pump and motor and the sensor PartSelect Number PS12070543. If those parts are tested and are fine, the issue would most likely be with the electronic board. I hope this helps.

Even on high heat my dishwasher will not dry dishes at all. Dishes are dripping wet at end of cycle.
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hello Susan, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model you have provided and we would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the heating element, the high limit thermostat, and the door vent. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Also if you don't already use a rinse aid, we would recommend using one to facilitate drying. We hope this helps.

light goes on but will not fill or drain
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hi Michael, thank you for contacting us. We would recommend checking the door latch, part number PS11756967, to fix the issue. It is at the top of the dishwasher door and keeps the door closed when the dishwasher is running. If this is faulty, the dishwasher may not start the cycle. We hope this sorts out your problem!

My dishwasher is not getting hot while washing dishes or drying. I have replaced the control panel. I have tested and replaced the heating element and also the switch. What else could it possibly be?
For model number WDF520PADM7
Hi Jason, thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend taking a look at the high-limit thermostat, part number PS11743423, to see if it is working or not. We hope that helps!

Hello Jane, Thank you for your question. To install the cable, first attach the cable to the hinge. Then attach the cable to the cable link and route it under the roller. Next, attach it to the short hook of the spring and lastly, place the large hook of the spring into the spring adjustment. We hope this helps.

Instruction on how to replace part number ps1174655, wp99002172. Jenn air dishwasher.

Hello Jane, Thank you for your question. To install the cable, first attach the cable to the hinge. Then attach the cable to the cable link and route it under the roller. Next, attach it to the short hook of the spring and lastly, place the large hook of the spring into the spring adjustment. We hope this helps.

Clogged drain
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hello Renny, thank you for your inquiry. The drain hose might be clogged. To unclog the drain hose, remove the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain and clean it out. The drain hose is most commonly clogged near the garbage disposer or dishwasher drain branch tailpiece. I hope this information helps!

Hi, I moved into a home with this dishwasher and I noticed my plates (standard dinner plates) is catching the water propeller so it won’t spin. I was hoping to order a rack adjuster to lift the second rack up ..maybe an inch so the water propeller will spin freely. Do you think this will work?
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hi Lynell, thank you for your inquiry. To fix the issue, you may need to replace the dishrack adjuster, part number PS11750092. The dishrack adjuster lets you change the height of the dishwasher's rack. Glad to be of help!

dishwasher lights come on and after enter command, the dishwasher does not start.
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hello Kenneth, thank you for the question. Make sure your Control Lock feature is not turned on. To turn off Control Lock, press and hold CONTROL LOCK or 4 HOUR DELAY (depending on model) for 3 seconds. The light turns off. f your model requires you to press and hold 4 HOUR DELAY to lock the controls, the Control Lock LED will be on or off to indicate if Control Lock is active or not. If this is not the issue, you will need to replace the control board, part number PS11759624. We hope this solves your problem!

Quincy
November 13, 2023
I had to replace the diverter valve seal to repair a water leak. In order to get at this I had to remove the lower rack from the dishwasher. It was not easy to remove the lower pull rack which in many dishwasher repair videos you merely pull the drawer all the way out and lift up and out. This model though uses ball bearing drawer glides which are difficult to separate from the lower rack. I found a video where you push or pull a plastic lever on each side to release the rack from the glides. However, now that I want to reinstall the rack it is not obvious how to do so and I ended up breaking the plastic lever on the right side. appeared to be very brittle. Not sure what I need to replace to fix this. Ready to replace the whole thing, or beat with a bat in the back yard or just continue to wash my dishes by hand. Poor design. Awful design. any help on how to fix this?
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hi Quincy, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description you have provided, you may need to replace the rack support right side, part number PS11755310. We have found the instructions to install the lower dish rack and the rack support. These may not be of the same model but will help you in installation. You may need to follow these steps: 1. Pull out the lower dish rack and lift up the locking tabs, bend the adjustable tine row to remove it from the rack supports. 2. Depress the retaining tab and slide the support back to detach. 3. Install the new support by properly aligning it on the rack. 4. Push forward to secure it. 5. Reinsert the ends of the adjustable tine row into the supports and snap it into place. 6. Reinstall the rack by aligning the supports on the tracks, then slide the rack back until the supports lock into place. We hope this information helps!

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

Clogged drain
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hello Renny, thank you for your inquiry. The drain hose might be clogged. To unclog the drain hose, remove the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain and clean it out. The drain hose is most commonly clogged near the garbage disposer or dishwasher drain branch tailpiece. I hope this information helps!

Hi, I moved into a home with this dishwasher and I noticed my plates (standard dinner plates) is catching the water propeller so it won’t spin. I was hoping to order a rack adjuster to lift the second rack up ..maybe an inch so the water propeller will spin freely. Do you think this will work?

Hi Lynell, thank you for your inquiry. To fix the issue, you may need to replace the dishrack adjuster, part number PS11750092. The dishrack adjuster lets you change the height of the dishwasher's rack. Glad to be of help!

dishwasher lights come on and after enter command, the dishwasher does not start.
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hello Kenneth, thank you for the question. Make sure your Control Lock feature is not turned on. To turn off Control Lock, press and hold CONTROL LOCK or 4 HOUR DELAY (depending on model) for 3 seconds. The light turns off. f your model requires you to press and hold 4 HOUR DELAY to lock the controls, the Control Lock LED will be on or off to indicate if Control Lock is active or not. If this is not the issue, you will need to replace the control board, part number PS11759624. We hope this solves your problem!

Quincy
November 13, 2023
I had to replace the diverter valve seal to repair a water leak. In order to get at this I had to remove the lower rack from the dishwasher. It was not easy to remove the lower pull rack which in many dishwasher repair videos you merely pull the drawer all the way out and lift up and out. This model though uses ball bearing drawer glides which are difficult to separate from the lower rack. I found a video where you push or pull a plastic lever on each side to release the rack from the glides. However, now that I want to reinstall the rack it is not obvious how to do so and I ended up breaking the plastic lever on the right side. appeared to be very brittle. Not sure what I need to replace to fix this. Ready to replace the whole thing, or beat with a bat in the back yard or just continue to wash my dishes by hand. Poor design. Awful design. any help on how to fix this?
For model number KDTE254ESS2
Hi Quincy, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description you have provided, you may need to replace the rack support right side, part number PS11755310. We have found the instructions to install the lower dish rack and the rack support. These may not be of the same model but will help you in installation. You may need to follow these steps: 1. Pull out the lower dish rack and lift up the locking tabs, bend the adjustable tine row to remove it from the rack supports. 2. Depress the retaining tab and slide the support back to detach. 3. Install the new support by properly aligning it on the rack. 4. Push forward to secure it. 5. Reinsert the ends of the adjustable tine row into the supports and snap it into place. 6. Reinstall the rack by aligning the supports on the tracks, then slide the rack back until the supports lock into place. We hope this information helps!

Replaced Hinge Link
Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough.

For model number PDW7880J10SS
Hello Jenn, thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend taking a look at the mounting bracket kit, part number PS311777, to see if it is correctly installed or not. It holds the top of the dishwasher to the side of the cabinet. We hope this solves your problem!

Dishwasher unit means forward when loading and u loading. Is a part missing or broken. A part that would keep unit from leaning guests when weight is applied
For model number PDW7880J10SS
Hello Jenn, thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend taking a look at the mounting bracket kit, part number PS311777, to see if it is correctly installed or not. It holds the top of the dishwasher to the side of the cabinet. We hope this solves your problem!

Lower rack wheel was melted
Unsnapped clip,and moved it 90 degrees. Slip wheel and clip off. Installed clip on new wheel. replaced new wheel. The wheel did not come with a new clip and was not suggested on the parts list. The existing clip was still OK but if it was not, I would have had to order a clip and wait. All in all, a good experience.

The rear wheels were missing on the lower rack.
The wheels came with a clip on part that clipped to the rack and the wheel snapped into that clip. I am a woman and it was easy for me to do. Thanks to Parts Select for being an easy to use and navigate site, for quick shipment and for good directions with the parts. Sincerely, Teresa from Alabama.
